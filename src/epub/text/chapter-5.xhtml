			<p>Columbus hail’d them with a father’s smile,<br/>
			Fruits of his cares and children of his toil;<br/>
			While still his eyes, thro tears of joy, descried<br/>
			Their course adventurous on the distant tide.<br/>
			Thus, when o’er deluged earth her Numen stood,<br/>
			The tost ark bounding on the shoreless flood,<br/>
			The sacred treasure fixt his guardian view,<br/>
			While climes unnoticed in the wave withdrew.</p>
			<p>The Hero saw them reach the rising strand,<br/>
			Leap from their ships and share the joyous land;<br/>
			Receding forests yield the laborers room,<br/>
			And opening wilds with fields and gardens bloom.<br/>
			Fill’d with the glance ecstatic, all his soul<br/>
			Now seems unbounded with the scene to roll,<br/>
			And now impatient, with retorted eye,<br/>
			Perceives his station in another sky:<br/>
			Waft me, indulgent Angel, waft me o’er,<br/>
			With those blest heroes, to the happy shore;<br/>
			There let me live and die. But all appears<br/>
			A fleeting vision! these are future years.<br/>
			Yet grant the illusion still may nearer spread,<br/>
			And my glad steps may seem their walks to tread;<br/>
			While Europe, wrapt in momentary night,<br/>
			Shall rise no more to intercept the sight.</p>
			<p>Columbus thus; when Hesper’s potent hand<br/>
			Moves brightening o’er the visionary land;<br/>
			The height that bore them still sublimer grew,<br/>
			And earth’s whole circuit settled from their view.<br/>
			A dusky deep, serene as breathless even,<br/>
			Seem’d vaulting downward like another heaven;<br/>
			The sun, rejoicing on his western way,<br/>
			Stampt his fair image in the inverted day:<br/>
			When now Hesperia’s coast arose more nigh,<br/>
			And life and action fill’d the dancing eye.</p>
			<p>Between the gulphs, where Laurence drains the world<br/>
			And where Floridia’s farthest floods are curl’d,<br/>
			Where midlands broad their swelling mountains heave<br/>
			And slope their champaigns to the Atlantic wave,<br/>
			The sandy streambank and the woodgreen plain<br/>
			Raise into sight the new-made seats of man.<br/>
			The placid ports, that break the seaborn gales,<br/>
			Shoot forth their quays and stretch aloft their sails,<br/>
			Full harvests wave, new groves with fruitage bend,<br/>
			Gay villas smile, defensive towers ascend;<br/>
			All the rich works of art their charms display,<br/>
			To court the planter and his cares repay:<br/>
			Till war invades; when soon the dales disclose<br/>
			Their meadows path’d with files of savage foes;<br/>
			High tufted quills their painted foreheads press,<br/>
			Dark spoils of beasts their shaggy shoulders dress,<br/>
			The bow bent forward for the combat strung,<br/>
			Ax, quiver, scalpknife on the girdle hung;<br/>
			Discordant yells, convulsing long the air,<br/>
			Tone forth at last the war whoop’s hideous blare.</p>
			<p>The Patriarch look’d; and every frontier height<br/>
			Pours down the swarthy nations to the fight.<br/>
			Where Kennebec’s high source forsakes the sky,<br/>
			Where long Champlain’s yet unkeel’d waters lie,<br/>
			Where Hudson crowds his hill-dissundering tide,<br/>
			Where Kaatskill dares the starry vault divide,<br/>
			Where the dim Alleganies sit sublime<br/>
			And give their streams to every neighboring clime,<br/>
			The swarms descended like an evening shade,<br/>
			And wolves and vultures follow’d where they spread.<br/>
			Thus when a storm, on eastern pinions driven,<br/>
			Meets the firm Andes in the midst of heaven,<br/>
			The clouds convulse, the torrents pour amain,<br/>
			And the black waters sweep the subject plain.</p>
			<p>Thro harvest fields the bloody myriads tread,<br/>
			Sack the lone village, strow the streets with dead;<br/>
			The flames in spiry volumes round them rise,<br/>
			And shrieks and shouts redoubling rend the skies.<br/>
			Fair babes and matrons in their domes expire,<br/>
			Or bursting frantic thro the folding fire<br/>
			They scream, fly, fall; promiscuous rave along<br/>
			The yelling victors and the driven throng;<br/>
			The streams run purple; all the peopled shore<br/>
			Is wrapt in flames and trod with steps of gore.<br/>
			Till colons, gathering from the shorelands far,<br/>
			Stretch their new standards and oppose the war,<br/>
			With muskets match the many-shafted bow,<br/>
			With loud artillery stun the astonish’d foe.<br/>
			When, like a broken wave, the barbarous train<br/>
			Lead back the flight and scatter from the plain<br/>
			Slay their weak captives, drop their shafts in haste,<br/>
			Forget their spoils and scour the trackless waste;<br/>
			From wood to wood in wild confusion hurl’d,<br/>
			They hurry o’er the hills far thro the savage world.</p>
			<p>Now move secure the cheerful works of peace,<br/>
			New temples rise and fruitful fields increase.<br/>
			Where Delaware’s wide waves behold with pride<br/>
			Penn’s beauteous town ascending on their side,<br/>
			The crossing streets in just allinement run,<br/>
			The walls and pavements sparkle to the sun,<br/>
			Like that famed city rose the checker’d plan,<br/>
			Whose spacious towers Semiramis began;<br/>
			Long ages finish’d what her hand design’d,<br/>
			The pride of kings and wonder of mankind.</p>
			<p>Newyork ascends o’er Hudson’s seaward isles,<br/>
			And flings the sunbeams from her glittering tiles;<br/>
			Albania, opening thro the distant wood,<br/>
			Rolls her rich treasures on her parent flood;<br/>
			Amid a thousand sails young Boston laves,<br/>
			High looms majestic Newport o’er the waves,<br/>
			Patapsco’s bay contracts his yielding side,<br/>
			As spreading Baltimore invades his tide;<br/>
			Aspiring Richmond tops the bank of James,<br/>
			And Charleston sways her two contending streams.</p>
			<p>Thro each colonial realm, for wisdom great,<br/>
			Elected sires assume the cares of state;<br/>
			Nursed in equality, to freedom bred,<br/>
			Firm is their step and straight the paths they tread;<br/>
			Dispensing justice with paternal hand,<br/>
			By laws of peace they rule the happy land;<br/>
			While reason’s page their statute codes unfold,<br/>
			And rites and charters flame in figured gold.<br/>
			All rights that Britons know they here transfuse,<br/>
			Their sense invigorate and expand their views,<br/>
			Dare every height of human soul to scan,<br/>
			Find, fathom, scope the moral breadth of man,<br/>
			Learn how his social powers may still dilate,<br/>
			And tone their tension to a stronger state.</p>
			<p>Round the long glade where lordly Laurence strays,<br/>
			Gaul’s migrant sons their forts and villas raise,<br/>
			Stretch over Canada their colon sway,<br/>
			And circling far beneath the western day<br/>
			Plant sylvan Wabash with a watchful post,<br/>
			O’er Missisippi spread a mantling host,<br/>
			Bid Louisiana’s lovely clime prepare<br/>
			New arts to prove and infant states to rear;<br/>
			While the bright lakes, that wide behind them spread,<br/>
			Unfold their channels to the paths of trade,<br/>
			Ohio’s waves their destined honors claim,<br/>
			And smile, as conscious of approaching fame.</p>
			<p>But Gallic planters still their trammels wear,<br/>
			Their feudal genius still attends them here;<br/>
			Dependent feelings for a distant throne<br/>
			Gyve the crampt soul that fears to think alone,<br/>
			Demand their rulers from the parent land,<br/>
			Laws ready made, and generals to command.<br/>
			Judge, priest and pedagogue, and all the slaves<br/>
			Of foreign masters, crowding o’er the waves,<br/>
			Spread thick the shades of vassalage and sloth,<br/>
			Absorb their labors and prevent their growth,<br/>
			Damp every thought that might their tyrants brave,<br/>
			And keep the vast domain a desert and a grave.</p>
			<p>Too soon the mother states, with jealous fear,<br/>
			Transport their feuds and homebred quarrels here.<br/>
			Now Gallia’s war-built barks ascend in sight,<br/>
			White flags unfold, and armies robed in white<br/>
			On all the frontier streams their forts prepare,<br/>
			And coop our cantons with surrounding war.<br/>
			Quebec, as proud she rears her rocky seat,<br/>
			Feeds their full camp and shades their anchored fleet:<br/>
			Oswego’s rampart frowns athwart his flood,<br/>
			And wild Ontario swells beneath his load.</p>
			<p>And now a friendly host from Albion’s strand<br/>
			Arrives to aid her young colonial band.<br/>
			They join their force, and tow’rd the falling day<br/>
			Impetuous Braddock leads their hasty way;<br/>
			O’er Allegany heights, like streams of fire,<br/>
			The red flags wave and glittering arms aspire<br/>
			To meet the savage hordes, who there advance<br/>
			Their skulking files to join the arms of France.</p>
			<p>Where, old as earth, yet still unstain’d with blood,<br/>
			Monongahela roll’d his careless flood,<br/>
			Flankt with his mantling groves the fountful hills,<br/>
			Drain’d the vast region thro his thousand rills,<br/>
			Lured o’er his lawns the buffle herds, and spread<br/>
			For all his fowls his piscatory glade;<br/>
			But now perceives, with hostile flag unfurl’d,<br/>
			A Gallic fortress awe the western world;<br/>
			There Braddock bends his march; the troops within<br/>
			Behold their danger and the fire begin.<br/>
			Forth bursting from the gates they rush amain,<br/>
			Front, flank and charge the fast approaching train;<br/>
			The batteries blaze, the leaden volleys pour,<br/>
			The vales, the streams, the solid mountains roar;<br/>
			Clouds of convolving smoke the welkin spread,<br/>
			The champaign shrouding in sulphureous shade.<br/>
			Lost in the rocking thunder’s loud career,<br/>
			No shouts nor groans invade the Patriarch’s ear,<br/>
			Nor valorous feats are seen, nor flight nor fall,<br/>
			But one broad burst of darkness buries all;<br/>
			Till chased by rising winds the smoke withdrew,<br/>
			And the wide slaughter open’d on his view.<br/>
			He saw the British leader borne afar,<br/>
			In dust and gore, beyond the wings of war;<br/>
			And while delirious panic seized his host,<br/>
			Their flags, their arms in wild confusion tost,<br/>
			Bold in the midst a youthful warrior strode,<br/>
			And tower’d undaunted o’er the field of blood;<br/>
			He checks the shameful rout, with vengeance burns,<br/>
			And the pale Britons brighten where he turns.<br/>
			So, when thick vapors veil the nightly sky,<br/>
			The starry host in half-seen lustre fly,<br/>
			Till Phosphor rises o’er the twinkling crowd,<br/>
			And gives new splendor thro his parting cloud.</p>
			<p>Swift on a fiery steed the stripling rose,<br/>
			Form’d the light files to pierce the line of foes;<br/>
			Then waved his gleamy sword that flash’d the day,<br/>
			And thro the Gallic legions hew’d his way:<br/>
			His troops press forward like a loose-broke flood,<br/>
			Sweep ranks away and smear their paths in blood;<br/>
			The hovering foes pursue the combat far,<br/>
			And shower their balls along the flying war;<br/>
			When the new leader turns his single force,<br/>
			Points the flight forward, speeds his backward course;<br/>
			The French recoiling half their victory yield,<br/>
			And the glad Britons quit the fatal field.</p>
			<p>These deathful deeds as great Columbus eyed,<br/>
			With anxious tone he thus addrest the Guide:<br/>
			Why combat here these transatlantic bands,<br/>
			And strow their corses thro thy pathless lands?<br/>
			Can Europe’s realms, the seat of endless strife,<br/>
			Afford no trophies for the waste of life?<br/>
			Can monarchs there no proud applauses gain,<br/>
			No living laurel for their people slain?<br/>
			Nor Belgia’s plains, so fertile made with gore,<br/>
			Hide heroes’ bones nor feast the vultures more?<br/>
			Will Rhine no longer cleanse the crimson stain,<br/>
			Nor Danube bear their bodies to the main,<br/>
			That infant empires here the shock must feel,<br/>
			And these pure streams with foreign carnage swell?<br/>
			But who that chief? his name, his nation say,<br/>
			Whose lifeblood seems his follies to repay;<br/>
			And who the youth, that from the combat lost<br/>
			Springs up and saves the remnant of his host?</p>
			<p>The Power replied: Each age successive brings<br/>
			Their varying views to earth’s contentious kings;<br/>
			Here roll the years when Albion’s parent hand,<br/>
			In aid of thy brave children, guards the land;<br/>
			That growing states their veteran force may train,<br/>
			A nobler prize in later fields to gain;<br/>
			In fields where Albion’s self shall turn their foe,<br/>
			Spread broader sails and aim a deadlier blow,<br/>
			Recross, in evil hour, the astonish’d wave,<br/>
			Her own brave sons to ravage and enslave.<br/>
			But here she combats with the powers of Gaul:<br/>
			Here her bold Braddock finds his destined fall;<br/>
			Thy Washington, in that young martial frame,<br/>
			From yon lost field begins a life of fame.<br/>
			’Tis he, in future straits, with loftier stride,<br/>
			The colon states to sovereign rule shall guide;<br/>
			When, prest by wrongs, their own full force they find,<br/>
			To wield the sword for man, and bulwark humankind.</p>
			<p>The Seraph spoke; when thro the purpled air<br/>
			The northern armies spread the flames of war.<br/>
			Swift o’er the lake, to Crownpoint’s fortful strand,<br/>
			Rash Abercrombie leads his headlong band<br/>
			To fierce unequal fight; the batteries roar,<br/>
			Shield the strong foes and rake the banner’d shore;<br/>
			Britannia’s sons again the contest yield,<br/>
			Again proud Gaul triumphant sweeps the field.</p>
			<p>But Amherst quick renews the raging toil,<br/>
			And drives wide hosting o’er Acadia’s isle;<br/>
			Young Wolfe beside him points the lifted lance,<br/>
			The boast of Britain and the scourge of France.<br/>
			The tide of victory here the heroes turn,<br/>
			And Gallic navies in their harbors burn;<br/>
			High flame the ships, the billows swell with gore,<br/>
			And the red standard shades the conquer’d shore.</p>
			<p>Wolfe, now detacht and bent on bolder deeds,<br/>
			A sail-borne host up sealike Laurence leads,<br/>
			Stems the long lessening tide; till Abraham’s height<br/>
			And famed Quebec rise frowning into sight.<br/>
			Swift bounding on the bank, the foe they claim.<br/>
			Climb the tall mountain like a rolling flame,<br/>
			Push wide their wings, high bannering bright the air,<br/>
			And move to fight as comets cope in war.<br/>
			The smoke falls folding thro the downward sky.<br/>
			And shrouds the mountain from the Patriarch’s eye,<br/>
			While on the towering top, in glare of day,<br/>
			The flashing swords in fiery arches play.<br/>
			As on a side-seen storm, adistance driven,<br/>
			The flames fork round the semivault of heaven,<br/>
			Thick thunders roll, descending torrents flow,<br/>
			Dash down the clouds and whelm the hills below;<br/>
			Or as on plains of light when Michael strove,<br/>
			The swords of cherubim to combat move,<br/>
			Ten thousand fiery forms together fray,<br/>
			And flash new lightning on empyreal day.</p>
			<p>Long raged promiscuous combat, half conceal’d,<br/>
			When sudden parle suspended all the field;<br/>
			Then roar the shouts, the smoke forsakes the plain<br/>
			And the huge hill is topt with heaps of slain.<br/>
			Stretch’d high in air Britannia’s standard waved,<br/>
			And good Columbus hail’d his country saved;<br/>
			While calm and silent, where the ranks retire,<br/>
			He saw brave Wolfe in victory’s arms expire.<br/>
			So the pale moon, when morning beams arise,<br/>
			Veils her lone visage in her midway skies;<br/>
			She needs no longer drive the shades away,<br/>
			Nor waits to view the glories of the day.</p>
			<p>Again the towns aspire; the cultured field<br/>
			And crowded mart their copious treasures yield;<br/>
			Back to his plough the colon soldier moves,<br/>
			And songs of triumph fill the warbling groves,<br/>
			The conscious flocks, returning joys that share,<br/>
			Spread thro the grassland o’er the walks of war,<br/>
			Streams, freed of gore, their crystal course regain,<br/>
			Serener sunbeams gild the tentless plain;<br/>
			A general jubilee, o’er earth and heaven,<br/>
			Leads the gay morn and lights the lambent even.</p>
			<p>Rejoicing, confident of long repose,<br/>
			(Their friends triumphant, far retired their foes,)<br/>
			The British colonies now feel their sway<br/>
			Span the whole north and crowd the western day.<br/>
			Acadia, Canada, earth’s total side,<br/>
			From Slave’s long lake to Pensacola’s tide,<br/>
			Expand their soils for them; and here unfold<br/>
			A range of highest hope, a promised age of gold.</p>
			<p>But soon from eastern seas dark vapors rise,<br/>
			Sweep the vast Occident and shroud the skies,<br/>
			Snatch all the vision from the Hero’s sight,<br/>
			And wrap the coast in sudden shades of night.<br/>
			He turn’d, and sorrowful besought the Power:<br/>
			Why sinks the scene, or must I view no more?<br/>
			Must here the fame of that young world descend?<br/>
			Shall our brave children find so quick their end?<br/>
			Where then the promised grace? “Thou soon shalt see<br/>
			That half mankind shall owe their seats to thee.”</p>
			<p>The Saint replied: Ere long, beneath thy view<br/>
			The scene shall brighten and thy joys renew.<br/>
			Here march the troublous years, when goaded sore<br/>
			Thy sons shall rise to change the ruling power;<br/>
			When Albion’s prince, who sways the happy land,<br/>
			To lawless rule extends his tyrant hand,<br/>
			To bind in slavery’s bands the peaceful host,<br/>
			Their rights unguarded and their charters lost.<br/>
			Now raise thine eye; from this delusive plain;<br/>
			What nations leap to life, what deeds adorn their fame!</p>
			<p>Columbus look’d; and still around them spread,<br/>
			From south to north, the immeasurable shade;<br/>
			At last the central darkness burst away,<br/>
			And rising regions opened on the day.<br/>
			Once more bright Delaware’s commercial stream<br/>
			And Penn’s throng’d city cast a cheerful gleam;<br/>
			The dome of state, as conscious of his eye,<br/>
			Now seem’d to silver in a loftier sky,<br/>
			Unfolding fair its gates; when lo, within<br/>
			The assembled states in solemn Congress shine.</p>
			<p>The sires elect from every province came,<br/>
			Where wide Columbia bore the British name,<br/>
			Where Freedom’s sons their highborn lineage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> trace,<br/>
			And homebred bravery still exalts the race:<br/>
			Her sons who plant each various vast domain<br/>
			That Chesapeak’s uncounted currents drain;<br/>
			The race who Roanoke’s clear stream bestride,<br/>
			Who fell the pine on Apalachia’s side,<br/>
			To Albemarle’s wide wave who trust their store,<br/>
			Who dike proud Pamlico’s unstable shore.<br/>
			Whose groaning barks o’erload the long Santee,<br/>
			Wind thro the realms and labor to the sea,<br/>
			(Their cumbrous cargoes, to the sail consign’d,<br/>
			Seek distant worlds, and feed and clothe mankind;)<br/>
			The race whose rice-fields suck Savanna’s urn,<br/>
			Whose verdant vines Oconee’s bank adorn;<br/>
			Who freight the Delaware with golden grain,<br/>
			Who tame their steeds on Monmouth’s flowery plain,<br/>
			From huge Toconnok hills who drag their ore,<br/>
			And sledge their corn to Hudson’s quay-built shore.<br/>
			Who keel Connecticut’s long meadowy tide,<br/>
			With patient plough his fallow plains divide,<br/>
			Spread their white flocks o’er Narraganset’s vale,<br/>
			Or chase to each chill pole the monstrous whale;<br/>
			Whose venturous prows have borne their fame afar,<br/>
			Tamed all the seas and steer’d by every star,<br/>
			Dispensed to earth’s whole habitants their store,<br/>
			And with their biting flukes have harrow’d every shore.</p>
			<p>The virtuous delegates behold with pain<br/>
			The hostile Britons hovering o’er the main,<br/>
			Lament the strife that bids two worlds engage,<br/>
			And blot their annals with fraternal rage;<br/>
			Two worlds in one broad state! whose bounds bestride,<br/>
			Like heaven’s blue arch, the vast Atlantic tide,<br/>
			By language, laws and liberty combined,<br/>
			Great nurse of thought, example to mankind.<br/>
			Columbia rears her warning voice in vain,<br/>
			Brothers to brothers call across the main;<br/>
			Britannia’s patriots lend a listening ear,<br/>
			But kings and courtiers push their mad career;<br/>
			Dissension raves, the sheathless falchions glare,<br/>
			And earth and ocean tremble at the war.</p>
			<p>Thus with stern brow, as worn by cares of state,<br/>
			His bosom big with dark unfolding fate,<br/>
			High o’er his lance the sacred Eagle spread,<br/>
			And earth’s whole crown still resting on his head,<br/>
			Rome’s hoary Genius rose, and mournful stood<br/>
			On roaring Rubicon’s forbidden flood,<br/>
			When Cesar’s ensigns swept the Alpine air,<br/>
			Led their long legions from the Gallic war,<br/>
			Paused on the opposing bank with wings unfurl’d,<br/>
			And waved portentous o’er the shuddering world.<br/>
			The god, with outstretch’d arm and awful look,<br/>
			Call’d the proud victor and prophetic spoke:<br/>
			Arrest, my son, thy parricidious hate,<br/>
			Pass not the stream nor stab my filial state,<br/>
			Stab not thyself, thy friends, thy total kind,<br/>
			And worlds and ages in one state combined.<br/>
			The chief, regardless of the warning god,<br/>
			Rein’d his rude steed and headlong past the flood,<br/>
			Cried, Farewel, Peace! took Fortune for his guide,<br/>
			And o’er his country pour’d the slaughtering tide.</p>
			<p>High on the foremost seat, in living light,<br/>
			Resplendent Randolph caught the world’s full sight.<br/>
			He opes the cause, and points in prospect far<br/>
			Thro all the toils that wait impending war:<br/>
			But, reverend sage! thy race must soon be o’er,<br/>
			To lend thy lustre and to shine no more.<br/>
			So the mild morning star, from shades of even,<br/>
			Leads up the dawn and lights the front of heaven,<br/>
			Points to the waking world the sun’s broad way,<br/>
			Then veils his own, and vaults above the day.<br/>
			And see bright Washington behind thee rise,<br/>
			Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies,<br/>
			O’er shadowy climes to pour enlivening flame,<br/>
			The charms of freedom and the fire of fame.<br/>
			For him the patriot bay beheld with pride<br/>
			The hero’s laurel springing by its side;<br/>
			His sword still sleeping rested on his thigh,<br/>
			On Britain still he cast a filial eye;<br/>
			But sovereign fortitude his visage bore,<br/>
			To meet her legions on the invaded shore.</p>
			<p>Sage Franklin next arose with cheerful mien,<br/>
			And smiled unruffled o’er the solemn scene;<br/>
			His locks of age a various wreath embraced,<br/>
			Palm of all arts that e’er a mortal graced;<br/>
			Beneath him lay the sceptre kings had borne,<br/>
			And the tame thunder<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a> from the tempest torn.</p>
			<p>Wythe, Mason, Pendleton with Henry join’d,<br/>
			Rush, Rodney, Langdon, friends of humankind,<br/>
			Persuasive Dickinson, the former’s boast,<br/>
			Recording Thomson, pride of all the host,<br/>
			Nash, Jay, the Livingstons, in council great,<br/>
			Rutledge and Laurens held the rolls of fate,<br/>
			O’er wide creation turn’d their ardent eyes,<br/>
			And bade the opprest to selfexistence rise;<br/>
			All powers of state, in their extended plan,<br/>
			Spring from consent, to shield the rights of man.<br/>
			Undaunted Wolcott urged the holy cause,<br/>
			With steady hand the solemn scene he draws;<br/>
			Stern thoughtful temperance with his ardorjoin’d,<br/>
			Nor kings nor worlds could warp his steadfast mind.</p>
			<p>With graceful ease but energetic tones;<br/>
			And eloquence that shook a thousand thrones,<br/>
			Majestic Hosmer stood; the expanding soul<br/>
			Darts from his eyebeams while his accents roll.<br/>
			But lo! the shaft of death untimely flew,<br/>
			And fell’d the patriot from the Hero’s view;<br/>
			Wrapt in the funeral shroud he sees descend<br/>
			The guide of nations and the Muse’s friend.<br/>
			Columbus dropt a tear; while Hesper’s eye<br/>
			Traced the freed spirit mounting thro the sky.</p>
			<p>Each generous Adams, freedom’s favorite pair,<br/>
			And Hancock rose the tyrant’s rage to dare,<br/>
			Groupt with firm Jefferson, her steadiest hope,<br/>
			Of modest mien but vast unclouded scope.<br/>
			Like four strong pillars of her state they stand,<br/>
			They clear from doubt her brave but wavering band;<br/>
			Colonial charters in their hands they bore,<br/>
			And lawless acts of ministerial power.<br/>
			Some injured right in every page appears,<br/>
			A king in terrors and a land in tears;<br/>
			From all his guileful plots the veil they drew,<br/>
			With eye retortive look’d creation thro,<br/>
			Traced moral nature thro her total plan,<br/>
			Markt all the steps of liberty and man;<br/>
			Crowds rose to reason while their accents rung.<br/>
			And <strong>Independence</strong> thunder’d from their tongue.</p>
			<p>Columbus turn’d; when rolling to the shore<br/>
			Swells o’er the seas an undulating roar;<br/>
			Slow, dark, portentous, as the meteors sweep.<br/>
			And curtain black the illimitable deep,<br/>
			High stalks, from surge to surge, a demon Form,<br/>
			That howls thro heaven and breathes a billowing storm.<br/>
			His head is hung with clouds; his giant hand<br/>
			Flings a blue flame far flickering to the land;<br/>
			His blood-stain’d limbs drip carnage as he strides,<br/>
			And taint with gory grume the staggering tides;<br/>
			Like two red suns his quivering eyeballs glare,<br/>
			His mouth disgorges all the stores of war,<br/>
			Pikes, muskets, mortars, guns and globes of fire.<br/>
			And lighted bombs that fusing trails exspire.<br/>
			Percht on his helmet, two twin sisters rode,<br/>
			The favorite offspring of the murderous god,<br/>
			Famine and Pestilence; whom whilom bore<br/>
			His wife, grim Discord, on Trinacria’s shore;<br/>
			When first their Cyclop sons, from Etna’s forge,<br/>
			Fill’d his foul magazine, his gaping gorge:<br/>
			Then earth convulsive groan’d, high shriek’d the air.<br/>
			And hell in gratulation call’d him War.</p>
			<p>Behind the fiend, swift hovering for the coast,<br/>
			Hangs o’er the wave Britannia’s sail-wing’d host;<br/>
			They crowd the main, they spread their sheets abroad,<br/>
			From the wide Laurence to the Georgian flood,<br/>
			Point their black batteries to the peopled shore,<br/>
			And spouting flames commence the hideous roar.</p>
			<p>Where fortless Falmouth, looking o’er her bay,<br/>
			In terror saw the approaching thunders play,<br/>
			The fire begins; the shells o’er arching fly,<br/>
			And shoot a thousand rainbows thro the sky;<br/>
			On Charlestown spires, on Bedford roofs they light,<br/>
			Groton and Fairfield kindle from the flight,<br/>
			Norwalk expands the blaze; o’er Reading hills<br/>
			High flaming Danbury the welkin fills;<br/>
			Esopus burns, Newyork’s delightful fanes<br/>
			And sea-nursed Norfolk light the neighboring plains.<br/>
			From realm to realm the smoky volumes bend,<br/>
			Reach round the bays and up the streams extend;<br/>
			Deep o’er the concave heavy wreaths are roll’d,<br/>
			And midland towns and distant groves infold.</p>
			<p>Thro solid curls of smoke, the bursting fires<br/>
			Climb in tall pyramids above the spires,<br/>
			Concentring all the winds; whose forces, driven<br/>
			With equal rage from every point of heaven,<br/>
			Whirl into conflict, round the scantling pour<br/>
			The twisting flames and thro the rafters roar,<br/>
			Suck up the cinders, send them sailing far,<br/>
			To warn the nations of the raging war,<br/>
			Bend high the blazing vortex, swell’d and curl’d,<br/>
			Careering, brightening o’er the lustred world,<br/>
			Absorb the reddening clouds that round them run,<br/>
			Lick the pale stars, and mock their absent sun:<br/>
			Seas catch the splendor, kindling skies resound,<br/>
			And falling structures shake the smouldering ground.</p>
			<p>Crowds of wild fugitives, with frantic tread,<br/>
			Flit thro the flames that pierce the midnight shade,<br/>
			Back on the burning domes revert their eyes,<br/>
			Where some lost friend, some perisht infant lies.<br/>
			Their maim’d, their sick, their age-enfeebled sires<br/>
			Have sunk sad victims to the sateless fires;<br/>
			They greet with one last look their tottering walls,<br/>
			See the blaze thicken, as the ruin falls,<br/>
			Then o’er the country train their dumb despair,<br/>
			And far behind them leave the dancing glare;<br/>
			Their own crusht roofs still lend a trembling light,<br/>
			Point their long shadows and direct their flight.<br/>
			Till wandering wide they seek some cottage door,<br/>
			Ask the vile pittance due the vagrant poor;<br/>
			Or faint and faltering on the devious road,<br/>
			They sink at last and yield their mortal load.</p>
			<p>But where the sheeted flames thro Charlestown roar,<br/>
			And lashing waves hiss round the burning shore,<br/>
			Thro the deep folding fires dread Bunker’s height<br/>
			Thunders o’er all and shows a field of fight.<br/>
			Like nightly shadows thro a flaming grove,<br/>
			To the dark fray the closing squadrons move;<br/>
			They join, they break, they thicken thro the glare,<br/>
			And blazing batteries burst along the war;<br/>
			Now wrapt in reddening smoke, now dim in sight,<br/>
			They rake the hill, or wing the downward flight;<br/>
			Here, wheel’d and wedged, Britannia’s veterans turn,<br/>
			And the long lightnings from their muskets burn;<br/>
			There scattering strive the thin colonial train,<br/>
			Whose broken platoons still the field maintain;<br/>
			Till Britain’s fresh battalions rise the height,<br/>
			And with increasing vollies give the fight.<br/>
			When, choked with dust, discolor’d deep in gore,<br/>
			And gall’d on all sides from the ships and shore,<br/>
			Hesperia’s host moves off the field afar,<br/>
			And saves, by slow retreat, the sad remains of war.</p>
			<p>There strides bold Putnam, and from all the plains<br/>
			Calls the tired troops, the tardy rear sustains,<br/>
			And, mid the whizzing balls that skim the lowe,<br/>
			Waves back his sword, defies the following foe.</p>
			<p>In this prime prelude of the toil that waits<br/>
			The nascent glories of his infant states,<br/>
			Columbus mourn’d the slain. A numerous crowd,<br/>
			Half of each host, had bought their fame with blood;<br/>
			From the whole hill he saw the lifestream pour,<br/>
			And sloping pathways trod with tracks of gore.<br/>
			Here, glorious Warren, thy cold earth was seen,<br/>
			Here spring thy laurels in immortal green;<br/>
			Dearest of chiefs that ever prest the plain,<br/>
			In freedom’s cause with early honors slain;<br/>
			Still dear in death, as when before our sight<br/>
			You graced the senate, or you led the fight.<br/>
			The grateful Muse shall tell the world your fame,<br/>
			And unborn realms resound the deathless name.</p>
			<p>Now from all plains, as settling smokes decay,<br/>
			The banded freemen rise in open day;<br/>
			Tall thro the lessening shadows, half conceal’d,<br/>
			They throng and gather in a central field;<br/>
			In unskill’d ranks but ardent soul they stand,<br/>
			Claim quick the foe, and eager strife demand.</p>
			<p>In front firm Washington superior shone,<br/>
			His eye directed to the half-seen sun;<br/>
			As thro the cloud the bursting splendors glow,<br/>
			And light the passage to the distant foe.<br/>
			His waving steel returns the living day,<br/>
			And points, thro unfought fields, the warrior’s way;<br/>
			His valorous deeds to be confined no more,<br/>
			Monongahela, to thy desert shore.<br/>
			Matured with years, with nobler glory warm,<br/>
			Fate in his eye and empire on his arm,<br/>
			He feels his sword the strength of nations wield,<br/>
			And moves before them with a broader shield.</p>
			<p>Greene rose beside him emulous in arms,<br/>
			His genius brightening as the danger warms,<br/>
			In counsel great, in every science skill’d,<br/>
			Pride of the camp and terror of the field.<br/>
			With eager look, conspicuous o’er the crowd,<br/>
			And port majestic, brave Montgomery strode,<br/>
			Bared his tried blade, with honor’s call elate,<br/>
			Claim’d the first field and hasten’d to his fate.<br/>
			Lincoln, with force unfolding as he rose,<br/>
			Scoped the whole war and measured well the foes;<br/>
			Calm, cautious, firm, for frugal counsels known,<br/>
			Frugal of other’s blood but liberal of his own.<br/>
			Heath for impending toil his falchion draws,<br/>
			And fearless Wooster aids the sacred cause,<br/>
			Mercer advanced an early death to prove,<br/>
			Sinclair and Mifflin swift to combat move;<br/>
			Here stood stern Putnam, scored with ancient scars.<br/>
			The living records of his country’s wars;<br/>
			Wayne, like a moving tower, assumes his post.<br/>
			Fires the whole field, and is himself a host;<br/>
			Undaunted Stirling, prompt to meet his foes,<br/>
			And Gates and Sullivan for action rose;<br/>
			Macdougal, Clinton, guardians of the state,<br/>
			Stretch the nerved arm to pierce the depth of fate;<br/>
			Marion with rapture seized the sword of fame,<br/>
			Young Laurens graced a father’s patriot name;<br/>
			Moultrie and Sumter lead their banded powers,<br/>
			Morgan in front of his bold riflers towers,<br/>
			His host of keen-eyed marksmen, skill’d to pour<br/>
			Their slugs unerring from the twisted bore.<br/>
			No sword, no bayonet they learn to wield,<br/>
			They gall the flank, they skirt the battling field,<br/>
			Cull out the distant foe in full horse speed,<br/>
			Couch the long tube and eye the silver bead,<br/>
			Turn as he turns, dismiss the whizzing lead,<br/>
			And lodge the death-ball in his heedless head.</p>
			<p>So toil’d the huntsman Tell. His quivering dart,<br/>
			Prest by the bended bowstring, fears to part,<br/>
			Dreads the tremendous task, to graze but shun<br/>
			The tender temples of his infant son;<br/>
			As the loved youth (the tyrant’s victim led)<br/>
			Bears the poised apple tottering on his head.<br/>
			The sullen father, with reverted eye,<br/>
			Now marks the satrap, now the bright-hair’d boy;<br/>
			His second shaft impatient lies, athirst<br/>
			To mend the expected error of the first,<br/>
			To pierce the monster, mid the insulted crowd,<br/>
			And steep the pangs of nature in his blood.<br/>
			Deep doubling tow’rd his breast, well poised and slow.<br/>
			Curve the strain’d horns of his indignant bow;<br/>
			His left arm straightens as the dexter bends,<br/>
			And his nerved knuckle with the gripe distends;<br/>
			Soft slides the reed back with the stiff drawn strand,<br/>
			Till the steel point has reacht his steady hand;<br/>
			Then to his keen fixt eye the shank he brings,<br/>
			Twangs the loud cord, the feather’d arrow sings.<br/>
			Picks off the pippin from the smiling boy,<br/>
			And Uri’s rocks resound with shouts of joy.<br/>
			Soon by an equal dart the tyrant bleeds,<br/>
			The cantons league, the work of fate proceeds;<br/>
			Till Austria’s titled hordes, with their own gore,<br/>
			Fat the fair fields they lorded long before;<br/>
			On Gothard’s height while freedom first unfurl’d<br/>
			Her infant banner o’er the modern world.</p>
			<p>Bland, Moylan, Sheldon the long lines enforce<br/>
			With light-arm’d scouts, with solid squares of horse;<br/>
			And Knox from his full park to battle brings<br/>
			His brazen tubes, <em>the last resort of kings</em>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a><br/>
			The long black rows in sullen silence wait,<br/>
			Their grim jaws gaping, soon to utter fate;<br/>
			When at his word the carbon clouds shall rise,<br/>
			And well aim’d thunders rock the shores and skies.</p>
			<p>Two foreign Youths had caught the splendent flame,<br/>
			To Fame’s hard school the warm disciples came;<br/>
			To learn sage Liberty’s unlesson’d lore,<br/>
			To brave the tempest on her war-beat shore,<br/>
			Prometheus like, to snatch a beam of day,<br/>
			And homeward bear the unscintillating ray,<br/>
			To pour new life on Europe’s languid horde,<br/>
			Where millions crouch beneath one stupid lord.<br/>
			Tho Austria’s keiser and the Russian czar<br/>
			To dungeons doom them, and with fetters mar,<br/>
			Fayette o’er Gaul’s vast realm some light shall spread,<br/>
			Brave Kosciusko rear Sarmatia’s head;<br/>
			From Garonne’s bank to Duna’s wintry skies,<br/>
			The morn shall move, and slumbering nations rise.<br/>
			And tho their despots quake with wild alarms,<br/>
			And lash and agonize the world to arms,<br/>
			Whelm for a while the untutor’d race in blood,<br/>
			And turn against themselves the raging flood;<br/>
			Yet shall the undying dawn, with silent pace,<br/>
			Reach over earth and every land embrace;<br/>
			Till Europe’s well taught sons the boon shall share,<br/>
			And bless the labors of the imprison’d Pair.</p>
			<p>So Leda’s Twins from Colchis raped the Fleece,<br/>
			And brought the treasure to their native Greece.<br/>
			She hail’d her heroes from their finished wars,<br/>
			Assigned their place amid the cluster’d stars,<br/>
			Bade round the eternal sky their trophies flame,<br/>
			And charged the zodiac with their deathless fame.<br/>
			—Here move the Strangers, here in freedom’s cause<br/>
			His untried blade each stripling hero draws,<br/>
			On the great chief their eyes in transport roll,<br/>
			And war and Washington renerve the soul.</p>
			<p>Steuben advanced, in veteran armor drest,<br/>
			For Prussian lore distinguish’d o’er the rest,<br/>
			The tactic lore; to this he bends his care,<br/>
			And here transplants the discipline of war.<br/>
			Other brave chieftains of illustrious name<br/>
			Rise into sight and equal honors claim;<br/>
			But who can tell the dew-drops of the morn,<br/>
			Or count the rays that in the diamond burn?<br/>
			—Grieve not, my valiant friends; the faithful song<br/>
			Shall soon redress the momentary wrong;<br/>
			Your own bright swords have cleaved your course to fame,<br/>
			And all her hundred tongues recognize every claim.</p>
			<p>Now the broad field as untaught warriors shade,<br/>
			The sun’s glad beam their shining arms display’d;<br/>
			High waved great Washington his glittering steel,<br/>
			Bade the long train in circling order wheel;<br/>
			And, while the banner’d youths around him prest,<br/>
			With voice revered he thus the ranks addrest:<br/>
			Ye generous bands, behold the task to save,<br/>
			Or yield whole nations to an instant grave.<br/>
			See hosted myriads crowding to your shore,<br/>
			Hear from all ports their vollied thunders roar;<br/>
			From Boston heights their bloody standards play,<br/>
			O’er long Champlain they lead their northern way,<br/>
			Virginian banks behold their streamers glide,<br/>
			And hostile navies load each southern tide.<br/>
			Beneath their steps your towns in ashes lie,<br/>
			Your inland empires feast their greedy eye;<br/>
			Soon shall your fields to lordly parks be turn’d,<br/>
			Your children butcher’d and your villas burn’d;<br/>
			While following millions, thro the reign of time.<br/>
			Who claim their birth in this indulgent clime,<br/>
			Bend the weak knee, to servile toils consigned,<br/>
			And sloth and slavery still degrade mankind.<br/>
			Rise then to war, to timely vengeance rise,<br/>
			Ere the gray sire, the helpless infant dies;<br/>
			Look thro the world, see endless years descend,<br/>
			What realms, what ages on your arms depend!<br/>
			Reverse the fate, avenge the insulted sky,<br/>
			Move to the work; we conquer or we die.</p>
			<p>So spoke Columbia’s chief; his guiding hand<br/>
			Points out their march to every ardent band,<br/>
			Assigns to each brave leader, as they claim,<br/>
			His test of valor and his task of fame.<br/>
			With his young host Montgomery first moves forth,<br/>
			To crush the vast invasion of the north;<br/>
			O’er streams and lakes their flags far onward play,<br/>
			Navies and forts surrendering mark their way;<br/>
			Rocks, fens and deserts thwart the paths they go,<br/>
			And hills before them lose their crags in snow.<br/>
			Loud Laurence, clogg’d with ice, indignant feels<br/>
			Their sleet-clad oars, choked helms and crusted keels;<br/>
			They buffet long his tides; when rise in sight<br/>
			Quebec’s dread walls, and Wolfe’s unclouded height<br/>
			Already there a few brave patriots stood,<br/>
			Worn down with toil, by famine half subdued;<br/>
			Untrench’d before the town, they dare oppose<br/>
			Their fielded cohorts to the forted foes.<br/>
			Ah gallant troop! deprived of half the praise<br/>
			That deeds like yours in other times repays,<br/>
			Since your prime chief (the favorite erst of fame)<br/>
			Hath sunk so deep his hateful, hideous name,<br/>
			That every honest Muse with horror flings<br/>
			The name unsounded from her sacred strings;<br/>
			Else what high tones of rapture must have told<br/>
			The first great action<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> of a chief so bold!<br/>
			’Twas his, ’twas yours, to brave unusual storms,<br/>
			To tame rude nature in her drearest forms;<br/>
			Foodless and guideless, thro that waste of earth,<br/>
			You march’d long months; and, sore reduced by dearth,<br/>
			Reach’d the proud capital, too feeble far<br/>
			To tempt unaided such a task of war;<br/>
			Till now Montgomery’s host, with hopes elate,<br/>
			Joins your scant powers, to try the test of fate.</p>
			<p>With skilful glance he views the fortress round.<br/>
			Bristled with pikes, with dark artillery crown’d;<br/>
			Resolves with naked steel to scale the towers,<br/>
			And snatch a realm from Britain’s hostile powers.<br/>
			Now drear December’s boreal blasts arise,<br/>
			A roaring hailstorm sweeps the shuddering skies,<br/>
			Night with condensing horror mantles all,<br/>
			And trembling watch-lights glimmer from the wall.<br/>
			From bombs o’erarching, fusing, bursting high,<br/>
			The glare scarce wanders thro the loaded sky;<br/>
			And in the louder shock of meteors drown’d,<br/>
			The accustom’d ear in vain expects the sound.</p>
			<p>He points the assault; and, thro the howling air,<br/>
			O’er rocky ramparts leads audacious war.<br/>
			Swift rise the rapid files; the walls are red<br/>
			With flashing flames, that show the piles of dead;<br/>
			Till back recoiling from the ranks of slain,<br/>
			They leave their leader with a feeble train,<br/>
			Begirt with foes within the sounding wall,<br/>
			Who thick beneath his single falchion fall.<br/>
			But short the conflict; others hemm’d him round,<br/>
			And brave Montgomery prest the gory ground.<br/>
			A second Wolfe Columbus here beheld,<br/>
			In youthful charms, a soul undaunted yield;<br/>
			Forlorn, o’erpower’d, his hardy host remains,<br/>
			Stretch’d by his side, or led in captive chains.<br/>
			Macpherson, Cheesman share their general’s doom;<br/>
			Meigs, Morgan, Dearborn, planning deeds to come,<br/>
			Resign impatient prisoners; soon to wield<br/>
			Their happier swords in many a broader field.</p>
			<p>Triumphant to Newyork’s ill forted post<br/>
			Britannia turns her vast amphibious host,<br/>
			That seas and storms, obedient to her hand,<br/>
			Heave and discharge on every distant land;<br/>
			Fleets, floating batteries shake Manhattan’s shore,<br/>
			And Hellgate rocks reverberate the roar.<br/>
			Swift o’er the shuddering isles that line the bay<br/>
			The red flags wave, and battering engines play;<br/>
			Howe leads aland the interminable train,<br/>
			While his bold brother still bestorms the main,<br/>
			Great Albion’s double pride; both famed afar<br/>
			On each vext element, each world of war;<br/>
			Where British rapine follows peaceful toil,<br/>
			And murders nations but to seize their spoil.</p>
			<p>Wide sweep the veteran myriads o’er the strand,<br/>
			Outnumbering thrice the raw colonial band;<br/>
			Flatbush and Harlem sink beneath their fires,<br/>
			Brave Stirling yields, and Sullivan retires.<br/>
			In vain sage Washington, from hill to hill,<br/>
			Plays round his foes with more than Fabian skill,<br/>
			Retreats, advances, lures them to his snare,<br/>
			To balance numbers by the shifts of war.<br/>
			For not their swords alone, but fell disease<br/>
			Thins his chill camp and chokes the neighboring seas.<br/>
			The baleful malady, from Syrius sent,<br/>
			floats in each breeze, impesting every tent,<br/>
			Strikes the young soldier with the morning ray,<br/>
			And lays him lifeless ere the close of day,<br/>
			Far from his father’s house, his mother’s care,<br/>
			And all the charities that nursed him there.</p>
			<p>Damp’d is the native rage that first impell’d<br/>
			The insulted colons to the battling field;<br/>
			When first their high-soul’d sentiment of right<br/>
			And full-vein’d vigor nerved their arm to fight.<br/>
			For stript of health, benumb’d thy vital flood,<br/>
			Thy muscles lax’d and decomposed thy blood,<br/>
			What is thy courage, man? a foodless flame,<br/>
			A light unseen, a soul without a frame.</p>
			<p>Each day the decimated ranks forgo<br/>
			Their dying comrades to repulse the foe,<br/>
			And each damp night, along the slippery trench,<br/>
			Breathe at their post the suffocating stench;<br/>
			They sink by hundreds on the vapory soil,<br/>
			Till a new fight relieves their deadlier toil.<br/>
			At last from fruitless combat, sore defeat,<br/>
			To Croton hills they lead a long retreat;<br/>
			Pale, curbed, exanimate, in dull despair,<br/>
			Train the scant relics of the twofold war:<br/>
			The sword, the pestilence press hard behind;<br/>
			The body both assail, and one beats down the mind.</p>
