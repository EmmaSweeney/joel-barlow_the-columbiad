			<p>But of all tales that war’s black annals hold,<br/>
			The darkest, foulest still remains untold;<br/>
			New modes of torture wait the shameful strife,<br/>
			And Britain wantons in the waste of life.</p>
			<p>Cold-blooded Cruelty, first fiend of hell,<br/>
			Ah think no more with savage hordes to dwell;<br/>
			Quit the Caribian tribes who eat their slain,<br/>
			Fly that grim gang, the Inquisitors of Spain,<br/>
			Boast not thy deeds in Moloch’s shrines of old,<br/>
			Leave Barbary’s pirates to their blood-bought gold,<br/>
			Let Holland steal her victims, force them o’er<br/>
			To toils and death on Java’s morbid shore;<br/>
			Some cloak, some color all these crimes may plead;<br/>
			’Tis avarice, passion, blind religion’s deed;<br/>
			But Britons here, in this fraternal broil,<br/>
			Grave, cool, deliberate in thy service toil.<br/>
			Far from the nation’s eye, whose nobler soul<br/>
			Their wars would humanize, their pride control,<br/>
			They lose the lessons that her laws impart,<br/>
			And change the British for the brutal heart.<br/>
			Fired by no passion, madden’d by no zeal,<br/>
			No priest, no Plutus bids them not to feel;<br/>
			Unpaid, gratuitous, on torture bent,<br/>
			Their sport is death, their pastime to torment;<br/>
			All other gods they scorn, but bow the knee,<br/>
			And curb, well pleased, O Cruelty, to thee.</p>
			<p>Come then, curst goddess, where thy votaries reign,<br/>
			Inhale their incense from the land and main;<br/>
			Come to Newyork, their conquering arms to greet,<br/>
			Brood o’er their camp and breathe along their fleet;<br/>
			The brother chiefs of Howe’s illustrious name<br/>
			Demand thy labors to complete their fame.<br/>
			What shrieks of agony thy praises sound!<br/>
			What grateless dungeons groan beneath the ground!<br/>
			See the black<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> Prison Ship’s expanding womb<br/>
			Impested thousands, quick and dead, entomb.<br/>
			Barks after barks the captured seamen bear,<br/>
			Transboard and lodge thy silent victims there;<br/>
			A hundred scows, from all the neighboring shore,<br/>
			Spread the dull sail and ply the constant oar,<br/>
			Waft wrecks of armies from the well fought field,<br/>
			And famisht garrisons who bravely yield;<br/>
			They mount the hulk, and, cramm’d within the cave,<br/>
			Hail their last house, their living, floating grave.</p>
			<p>She comes, the Fiend! her grinning jaws expand,<br/>
			Her brazen eyes cast lightning o’er the strand,<br/>
			Her wings like thunder-clouds the welkin sweep,<br/>
			Brush the tall spires and shade the shuddering deep;<br/>
			She gains the deck, displays her wonted store,<br/>
			Her cords and scourges wet with prisoners’ gore;<br/>
			Gripes, pincers, thumb-screws spread beneath her feet,<br/>
			Slow poisonous drugs and loads of putrid meat;<br/>
			Disease hangs drizzling from her slimy locks,<br/>
			And hot contagion issues from her box.</p>
			<p>O’er the closed hatches ere she takes her place,<br/>
			She moves the massy planks a little space,<br/>
			Opes a small passage to the cries below,<br/>
			That feast her soul on messages of woe;<br/>
			There sits with gaping ear and changeless eye,<br/>
			Drinks every groan and treasures every sigh,<br/>
			Sustains the faint, their miseries to prolong,<br/>
			Revives the dying and unnerves the strong.</p>
			<p>But as the infected mass resign their breath.<br/>
			She keeps with joy the register of death.<br/>
			As tost thro portholes from the encumber’d cave,<br/>
			Corpse after corpse fall dashing in the wave;<br/>
			Corpse after corpse, for days and months and years,<br/>
			The tide bears off, and still its current clears;<br/>
			At last, o’erloaded with the putrid gore,<br/>
			The slime-clad waters thicken round the shore.<br/>
			Green Ocean’s self, that oft his wave renews,<br/>
			That drinks whole fleets with all their battling crews,<br/>
			That laves, that purifies the earth and sky,<br/>
			Yet ne’er before resign’d his natural dye,<br/>
			Here purples, blushes for the race he bore<br/>
			To rob and ravage this unconquer’d shore;<br/>
			The scaly nations, as they travel by,<br/>
			Catch the contagion, sicken, gasp and die.</p>
			<p>Now Hesper turns the Hero’s tearful eye<br/>
			To other fields where other standards fly;<br/>
			For here constrain’d new warfare to disclose,<br/>
			And show the feats of more than mortal foes,<br/>
			Where interposing with celestial might,<br/>
			His own dread labors must decide the fight,<br/>
			He bids the scene with pomp unusual rise,<br/>
			To teach Columbus how to read the skies.</p>
			<p>He marks the trace of Howe’s triumphant course,<br/>
			And wheels o’er Jersey plains his gathering force;<br/>
			Where dauntless Washington, begirt with foes,<br/>
			Still greater rises as the danger grows,<br/>
			And wearied troops, o’er kindred warriors slain,<br/>
			Attend his march thro many a sanguine plain.</p>
			<p>From Hudson’s bank to Trenton’s wintry strand,<br/>
			He guards in firm retreat his feeble band;<br/>
			Britons by thousands on his flanks advance,<br/>
			Bend o’er his rear and point the lifted lance.<br/>
			Past Delaware’s frozen stream, with scanty force,<br/>
			He checks retreat; then turning back his course,<br/>
			Remounts the wave, and thro the mingled roar<br/>
			Of ice and storm reseeks the hostile shore,<br/>
			Wrapt in the gloom of night. The offended Flood<br/>
			Starts from his cave, assumes the indignant god,<br/>
			Rears thro the parting tide his foamy form,<br/>
			And with his fiery eyeballs lights the storm.<br/>
			He stares around him on the host he heard,<br/>
			Clears his choked urn and smooths his icy beard,<br/>
			And thus: Audacious chief, this troubled wave<br/>
			Tempt not; or tempting, here shall gape thy grave.<br/>
			Is nothing sacred to thy venturous might?<br/>
			The howling storm, the holy truce of night,<br/>
			High tossing ice-isles crashing round thy side,<br/>
			Insidious rocks that pierce the tumbling tide?<br/>
			Fear then this forceful arm, and hear once more,<br/>
			Death stands between thee and that shelvy shore.</p>
			<p>The chief beholds the god, and notes his cry,<br/>
			But onward drives, nor pauses to reply;<br/>
			Calls to each bark, and spirits every host<br/>
			To toil, gain, tempt the interdicted coast.<br/>
			The crews, regardless of the doubling roar,<br/>
			Breast the strong helm, and wrestle with the oar,<br/>
			Stem with resurgent prow the struggling spray,<br/>
			And with phosphoric lanterns shape their way.</p>
			<p>The god perceived his warning words were vain,<br/>
			And rose more furious to assert his reign,<br/>
			Lash’d up a loftier surge, and heaved on high<br/>
			A ridge of billows that obstruct the sky;<br/>
			And, as the accumulated mass he rolls,<br/>
			Bares the sharp rocks and lifts the gaping shoals.<br/>
			Forward the fearless barges plunge and bound,<br/>
			Top the curl’d wave, or grind the flinty ground,<br/>
			Careen, whirl, right, and sidelong dasht and tost,<br/>
			Now seem to reach and now to lose the coast.</p>
			<p>Still unsubdued the sea-drench’d army toils,<br/>
			Each buoyant skiff the flouncing godhead foils;<br/>
			He raves and roars, and in delirious woe<br/>
			Calls to his aid his ancient hoary foe,<br/>
			Almighty Frost; when thus the vanquish’d Flood<br/>
			Bespeaks in haste the great earth-rending god:<br/>
			Father of storms! behold this mortal race<br/>
			Confound my force and brave me to my face.<br/>
			Not all my waves by all my tempests driven,<br/>
			Nor black night brooding o’er the starless heaven,<br/>
			Can check their course; they toss and plunge amain,<br/>
			And lo, my guardian rocks project their points in vain.</p>
			<p>Come to my help, and with thy stiffening breath<br/>
			Clog their strain’d helms, distend their limbs indeath.<br/>
			Tho ancient enmity our realms divide,<br/>
			And oft thy chains arrest my laboring tide,<br/>
			Let strong necessity our cause combine,<br/>
			Thy own disgrace anticipate in mine;<br/>
			Even now their oars thy sleet in vain congeals,<br/>
			Thy crumbling ice-cakes crash beneath their keels;<br/>
			Their impious arms already cope with ours,<br/>
			And mortal man defies immortal Powers.</p>
			<p>Roused at the call, the Monarch mounts the storm;<br/>
			In muriat flakes he robes his nitrous form,<br/>
			Glares thro the compound, all its blast inhales,<br/>
			And seas turn crystal where he breathes his gales.<br/>
			He comes careering o’er his bleak domain,<br/>
			But comes untended by his usual train;<br/>
			Hail, sleet and snow-rack far behind him fly,<br/>
			Too weak to wade thro this petrific sky,<br/>
			Whose air consolidates and cuts and stings,<br/>
			And shakes hoar tinsel from its flickering wings.<br/>
			Earth heaves and cracks beneath the alighting god;<br/>
			He gains the pass, bestrides the roaring flood,<br/>
			Shoots from his nostrils one wide withering sheet<br/>
			Of treasured meteors on the struggling fleet;<br/>
			The waves conglaciate instant, fix in air,<br/>
			Stand like a ridge of rocks, and shiver there.<br/>
			The barks, confounded in their headlong surge,<br/>
			Or wedged in crystal, cease their oars to urge;<br/>
			Some with prone prow, as plunging down the deep,<br/>
			And some remounting o’er the slippery steep<br/>
			Seem laboring still, but moveless, lifeless all;<br/>
			And the chill’d army here awaits its fall.</p>
			<p>But Hesper, guardian of Hesperia’s right,<br/>
			From his far heaven looks thro the rayless night;<br/>
			And, stung to vengeance at the unequal strife,<br/>
			To save her host, in jeopardy of life,<br/>
			Starts from his throne, ascends his flamy car.<br/>
			And turns tremendous to the field of war.<br/>
			His wheels, resurging from the depth of even,<br/>
			Roll back the night, streak wide the startled heaven,<br/>
			Regain their easting with reverted gyres,<br/>
			And stud their path with scintillating fires.<br/>
			He cleaves the clouds; and, swift as beams of day,<br/>
			O’er California sweeps his splendid way;<br/>
			Missouri’s mountains at his passage nod,<br/>
			And now sad Delaware feels the present god,<br/>
			And trembles at his tread. For here to fight<br/>
			Rush two dread Powers of such unmeasured might,<br/>
			As threats to annihilate his doubtful reign,<br/>
			Convulse the heaven and mingle earth and main.</p>
			<p>Frost views his brilliant foe with scornful eye,<br/>
			And whirls a tenfold tempest thro the sky;<br/>
			Where each fine atom of the immense of air,<br/>
			Steel’d, pointed, barb’d for unexampled war,<br/>
			Sings o’er the shuddering ground; when thus he broke<br/>
			Contemptuous silence, and to Hesper spoke:<br/>
			Thou comest in time to share their last disgrace,<br/>
			To change to crystal with thy rebel race,<br/>
			Stretch thy huge corse o’er Delaware’s bank afar,<br/>
			And learn the force of elemental war.<br/>
			Or if undying life thy lamp inspire,<br/>
			Take that one blast and to thy sky retire;<br/>
			There, roll’d eternal round the heavens, proclaim<br/>
			Thy own disaster and my deathless fame.</p>
			<p>I come, said Hesper, not to insult the brave,<br/>
			But break thy sceptre and let loose my wave,<br/>
			Teach the proud Stream more peaceful tides to roll,<br/>
			And send thee howling to thy stormy pole;<br/>
			That drear dominion shall thy rage confine;<br/>
			This land, these waters and those troops are mine.</p>
			<p>He added not; and now the sable storm,<br/>
			Pierced by strong splendor, burst before his form;<br/>
			His visage stern an awful lustre shed,<br/>
			His pearly planet play’d around his head.<br/>
			He seized a lofty pine, whose roots of yore<br/>
			Struck deep in earth, to guard the sandy shore<br/>
			From hostile ravage of the mining tide,<br/>
			That rakes with spoils of earth its crumbling side.<br/>
			He wrencht it from the soil, and o’er the foe<br/>
			Whirl’d the strong trunk, and aim’d a sweeping blow,<br/>
			That sung thro air, but miss’d the moving god,<br/>
			And fell wide crashing on the frozen flood.<br/>
			For many a rood the shivering ice it tore,<br/>
			Loosed every bark and shook the sounding shore;<br/>
			Stroke after stroke with doubling force he plied,<br/>
			Foil’d the hoar Fiend and pulverized the tide.<br/>
			The baffled tyrant quits the desperate cause;<br/>
			From Hesper’s heat the river swells and thaws,<br/>
			The fleet rolls gently to the Jersey coast,<br/>
			And morning splendors greet the landing host.</p>
			<p>’Tis here dread Washington, when first the day<br/>
			O’er Trenton beam’d to light his rapid way,<br/>
			Pour’d the rude shock on Britain’s vanguard train,<br/>
			And led whole squadrons in his captive chain;<br/>
			Where veteran troops to half their numbers yield,<br/>
			Tread back their steps, or press the sanguine field,<br/>
			To Princeton plains precipitate their flight,<br/>
			Thro new disasters and unfinish’d fight,<br/>
			Resign their conquests by one sad surprise,<br/>
			Sink in their pride and see their rivals rise.</p>
			<p>Here dawn’d the daystar of Hesperia’s fame,<br/>
			Here herald glory first emblazed her name;<br/>
			On Delaware’s bank her base of empire stands,<br/>
			The work of Washington’s immortal hands;<br/>
			Prompt at his side while gallant Mercer trod,<br/>
			And seal’d the firm foundation with his blood.</p>
			<p>In future years, if right the Muse divine,<br/>
			Some great memorial on this bank shall shine;<br/>
			A column bold its granite shaft shall rear,<br/>
			Swell o’er the strand and check the passing air,<br/>
			Cast its broad image on the watery glade,<br/>
			And Bristol greet the monumental shade;<br/>
			Eternal emblem of that gloomy hour,<br/>
			When the great general left her storm-beat shore,<br/>
			To tempest, night and his own sword consign’d<br/>
			His country’s fates, the fortunes of mankind.</p>
			<p>Where sealike Laurence, rolling in his pride,<br/>
			With Ocean’s self disputes the tossing tide,<br/>
			From shore to shore, thro dim distending skies,<br/>
			Beneath full sails imbanded nations rise.<br/>
			Britain and Brunswick here their flags unfold,<br/>
			Here Hessia’s hordes, for toils of slaughter sold,<br/>
			Anspach and Darmstadt swell the hireling train,<br/>
			Proud Caledonia crowds the masted main,<br/>
			Hibernian kerns and Hanoverian slaves<br/>
			Move o’er the decks and darken wide the waves.</p>
			<p>Tall on the boldest bark superior shone<br/>
			A warrior ensign’d with a various crown;<br/>
			Myrtles and laurels equal honors join’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a><br/>
			Which arms had purchased and the Muses twined;<br/>
			His sword waved forward, and his ardent eye<br/>
			Seem’d sharing empires in the southern sky.<br/>
			Beside him rose a herald to proclaim<br/>
			His various honors, titles, feats and fame;<br/>
			Who raised an opening scroll, where proudly shone<br/>
			<em>Burgoyne and vengeance from the British throne</em>.</p>
			<p>Champlain receives the congregated host,<br/>
			And his husht waves beneath the sails are lost;<br/>
			Ticonderoga rears his rocks in vain,<br/>
			Nor Edward’s walls the weighty shock sustain;<br/>
			Deep George’s loaded lake reluctant guides<br/>
			Their bounding barges o’er his<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> sacred tides.<br/>
			State after state the splendid pomp appalls,<br/>
			Each town surrenders, every fortress falls;<br/>
			Sinclair retires; and with his feeble train,<br/>
			In slow retreat o’er many a fatal plain,<br/>
			Allures their march; wide moves their furious force,<br/>
			And flaming hamlets mark their wasting course;<br/>
			Thro fortless realms their spreading ranks are wheel’d,<br/>
			On Mohawk’s wrestern wave, on Bennington’s dread field.</p>
			<p>At last where Hudson, with majestic pace,<br/>
			Swells at the sight, and checks his rapid race,<br/>
			Thro dark Stillwater slow and silent moves,<br/>
			And flying troops with sullen pause reproves,<br/>
			A few firm bands their starry standard rear,<br/>
			Wheel, front and face the desolating war.<br/>
			Sudden the patriot flame each province warms,<br/>
			Deep danger calls, the freemen quit their farms,<br/>
			Seize their tried muskets, name their chiefs to lead,<br/>
			Endorse their knapsacks and to vengeance speed.<br/>
			O’er all the land the kindling ardor flies,<br/>
			Troop follows troop, and flags on flags arise,<br/>
			Concentred, train’d, their forming files unite,<br/>
			Swell into squadrons and demand the fight.</p>
			<p>When Xerxes, raving at his sire’s disgrace,<br/>
			Pour’d his dark millions on the coast of Thrace,<br/>
			O’er groaning Hellespont his broad bridge hurl’d,<br/>
			Hew’d ponderous Athos from the trembling world,<br/>
			Still’d with his weight of ships the struggling main,<br/>
			And bound the billows in his boasted chain,<br/>
			Wide o’er proud Macedon he wheel’d his course,<br/>
			Thrace, Thebes, Thessalia join’d his furious force.<br/>
			Thro six torn states his hovering swarms increase,<br/>
			And hang tremendous on the skirts of Greece;<br/>
			Deep groan the shrines of all her guardian gods,<br/>
			Sad Pelion shakes, divine Olympus nods,<br/>
			Shock’d Ossa sheds his hundred hills of snow,<br/>
			And Tempe swells her murmuring brook below;<br/>
			Wild in her starts of rage the Pythian shrieks,<br/>
			Dodona’s Oak the pangs of nature speaks,<br/>
			Eleusis quakes thro all her mystic caves,<br/>
			And black Trophonius gapes a thousand graves.<br/>
			But soon the freeborn Greeks to vengeance rise,<br/>
			Brave Sparta springs where first the danger lies,<br/>
			Her self-devoted Band, in one steel’d mass,<br/>
			Plunge in the gorge of death, and choke the Pass,<br/>
			Athenian youths, the unwieldy war to meet,<br/>
			Couch the stiff lance, or mount the well arm’d fleet;<br/>
			They sweep the incumber’d seas of their vast load,<br/>
			And fat their fields with lakes of Asian blood.</p>
			<p>So leapt our youths to meet the invading hordes,<br/>
			Fame fired their courage, freedom edged their swords.<br/>
			Gates in their van on high-hill’d Bemus rose,<br/>
			Waved his blue steel and dared the headlong foes;<br/>
			Undaunted Lincoln, laboring on his right,<br/>
			Urged every arm, and gave them hearts to fight;<br/>
			Starke, at the dexter flank, the onset claims,<br/>
			Indignant Herkimer the left inflames;<br/>
			He bounds exulting to commence the strife.<br/>
			And buy the victory with his barter’d life.</p>
			<p>And why, sweet Minstrel, from the harp of fame<br/>
			Withhold so long that once resounding name?<br/>
			The chief who, steering by the boreal star,<br/>
			O’er wild Canadia led our infant war,<br/>
			In desperate straits superior powers display’d,<br/>
			Burgoyne’s dread scourge, Montgomery’s ablest aid;<br/>
			Ridgefield and Compo saw his valorous might<br/>
			With ill-arm’d swains put veteran troops to flight.<br/>
			Tho treason foul hath since absorb’d his soul,<br/>
			Bade waves of dark oblivion round him roll,<br/>
			Sunk his proud heart abhorrent and abhorr’d,<br/>
			Effaced his memory and defiled his sword;<br/>
			Yet then untarnisht roll’d his conquering car;<br/>
			Then famed and foremost in the ranks of war<br/>
			Brave Arnold trod; high valor warm’d his breast,<br/>
			And beams of glory play’d around his crest.<br/>
			Here toils the chief; whole armies from his eye<br/>
			Resume their souls, and swift to combat fly.</p>
			<p>Camp’d on a hundred hills, and trench’d in form,<br/>
			Burgoyne’s long legions view the gathering storm;<br/>
			Uncounted nations round their general stand,<br/>
			And wait the signal from his guiding hand.<br/>
			Canadia crowds her Gallic colons there,<br/>
			Ontario’s yelling tribes torment the air,<br/>
			Wild Huron sends his lurking hordes from far,<br/>
			Insidious Mohawk swells the woodland war;<br/>
			Scalpers and ax-men rush from Erie’s shore,<br/>
			And Iroquois augments the war whoop roar;<br/>
			While all his ancient troops his train supply,<br/>
			Half Europe’s banners waving thro the sky;<br/>
			Deep squadron’d horse support his endless flanks,<br/>
			And park’d artillery frowns behind the ranks.<br/>
			Flush’d with the conquest of a thousand fields,<br/>
			And rich with spoils that all the region yields,<br/>
			They burn with zeal to close the long campaign,<br/>
			And crush Columbia on this final plain.</p>
			<p>His fellow chiefs inhale the hero’s flame,<br/>
			Nerves of his arm and partners in his fame:<br/>
			Phillips, with treasured thunders poised and wheel’d<br/>
			In brazen tubes, prepares to rake the field;<br/>
			The trench-tops darken with the sable rows,<br/>
			And, tipt with fire, the waving match-rope glows.<br/>
			There gallant Reidesel in German guise,<br/>
			And Specht and Breyman, prompt for action, rise;<br/>
			His savage hordes the murderous Johnson<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a> leads,<br/>
			Files thro the woods and treads the tangled weeds,<br/>
			Shuns open combat, teaches where to run,<br/>
			Skulk, couch the ambush, aim the hunter’s gun,<br/>
			Whirl the sly tomahawk, the war whoop sing,<br/>
			Divide the spoils and pack the scalps they bring.</p>
			<p>Frazer in quest of glory seeks the field;⁠—<br/>
			False glare of glory, what hast thou to yield?<br/>
			How long, deluding phantom, wilt thou blind,<br/>
			Mislead, debase, unhumanize mankind?<br/>
			Bid the bold youth, his headlong sword who draws,<br/>
			Heed not the object, nor inquire the cause;<br/>
			But seek adventuring, like an errant knight,<br/>
			Wars not his own, gratuitous in fight,<br/>
			Greet the gored field, then plunging thro the fire,<br/>
			Mow down his men, with stupid pride expire,<br/>
			Shed from his closing eyes the finish’d flame,<br/>
			And ask, for all his crimes, a deathless name?<br/>
			And when shall solid glory, pure and bright,<br/>
			Alone inspire us, and our deeds requite?<br/>
			When shall the applause of men their chiefs pursue<br/>
			In just proportion to the good they do,<br/>
			On virtue’s base erect the shrine of fame,<br/>
			Define her empire, and her code proclaim?</p>
			<p>Unhappy Frazer! little hast thou weigh’d<br/>
			The crirneful cause thy valor comes to aid.<br/>
			Far from thy native land, thy sire, thy wife,<br/>
			Love’s lisping race that cling about thy life,<br/>
			Thy soul beats high, thy thoughts expanding roam<br/>
			On battles past, and laurels yet to come:<br/>
			Alas, what laurels? where the lasting gain?<br/>
			A pompous funeral on a desert plain!<br/>
			The cannon’s roar, the muffled drums proclaim,<br/>
			In one short blast, thy momentary fame,<br/>
			And some war minister per-hazard reads<br/>
			In what far field the tool of placemen bleeds.</p>
			<p>Brave Heartly strode in youth’s o’erweening pride;<br/>
			Housed in the camp he left his blooming bride,<br/>
			The sweet Lucinda; whom her sire from far,<br/>
			On steeds high bounding o’er the waste of war,<br/>
			Had guided thro the lines, and hither led,<br/>
			That fateful morn, the plighted chief to wed.<br/>
			He deem’d, deluded sire! the contest o’er,<br/>
			That routed rebels dared the fight no more;<br/>
			And came to mingle, as the tumult ceased,<br/>
			The victor’s triumph with the nuptial feast.<br/>
			They reach’d his tent; when now with loud alarms<br/>
			The morn burst forth and roused the camp to arms;<br/>
			Conflicting passions seized the lover’s breast,<br/>
			Bright honor call’d, and bright Lucinda prest:⁠—<br/>
			And wilt thou leave me for that clangorous call?<br/>
			Traced I these deserts but to see thee fall?<br/>
			I know thy valorous heart, thy zeal that speeds<br/>
			Where dangers press and boldest battle bleeds.<br/>
			My father said blest Hymen here should join<br/>
			With sacred Love to make Lucinda thine;<br/>
			But other union these dire drums foredoom,<br/>
			The dark dead union of the eternal tomb.<br/>
			On yonder plain, soon sheeted o’er with blood,<br/>
			Our nuptial couch shall prove a crimson clod;<br/>
			For there this night thy livid corse must lie,<br/>
			I’ll seek it there, and on that bosom die.<br/>
			Yet go; ’tis duty calls; but o’er thy head<br/>
			Let this white plume its floating foliage spread;<br/>
			That from the rampart, thro the troubled air,<br/>
			These eyes may trace thee toiling in the war.<br/>
			She fixt the feather on his crest above,<br/>
			Bound with the mystic knot, the knot of love;<br/>
			He parted silent, but in silent prayer<br/>
			Bade Love and Hymen guard the timorous fair.</p>
			<p>Where Saratoga show’d her champaign side,<br/>
			That Hudson bathed with still untainted tide,<br/>
			The opposing pickets push’d their scouting files,<br/>
			Wheel’d skirmisht, halted, practised all their wiles;<br/>
			Each to mislead, insnare, exhaust their foes,<br/>
			And court the conquest ere the armies close.</p>
			<p>Now roll like winged storms the solid lines,<br/>
			The clarion thunders and the battle joins,<br/>
			Thick flames in vollied flashes load the air,<br/>
			And echoing mountains give the noise of war;<br/>
			Sulphureous clouds rise reddening round the height,<br/>
			And veil the skies, and wrap the sounding fight.<br/>
			Soon from the skirts of smoke, where thousands toil,<br/>
			Ranks roll away and into light recoil;<br/>
			Starke pours upon them in a storm of lead;<br/>
			His hosted swains bestrew the field with dead,<br/>
			Pierce with strong bayonets the German reins,<br/>
			Whelm two battalions in their captive chains,<br/>
			Bid Baum, with wounds enfeebled, quit the field,<br/>
			And Breyman next his gushing lifeblood yield.</p>
			<p>This Frazer sees, and thither turns his course,<br/>
			Bears down before them with Britannia’s force,<br/>
			Wheels a broad column on the victor flank,<br/>
			And springs to vengeance thro the foremost rank.<br/>
			Lincoln, to meet the hero, sweeps the plain;<br/>
			His ready bands the laboring Starke sustain;<br/>
			Host matching host, the doubtful battle burns,<br/>
			And now the Britons, now their foes by turns<br/>
			Regain the ground; till Frazer feels the force<br/>
			Of a rude grapeshot in his flouncing horse;<br/>
			Nor knew the chief, till struggling from the fall,<br/>
			That his gored thigh had first received the ball.<br/>
			He sinks expiring on the slippery soil;<br/>
			Shock’d at the sight, his baffled troops recoil;<br/>
			Where Lincoln, pressing with redoubled might,<br/>
			Broke thro their squadrons and confirmed the flight;<br/>
			When this brave leader met a stunning blow,<br/>
			That stopt his progress and avenged the foe.<br/>
			He left the field; but prodigal of life,<br/>
			Unwearied Francis still prolong’d the strife;<br/>
			Till a chance carabine attained his head,<br/>
			And stretch’d the hero mid the vulgar dead.<br/>
			His near companions rush with ardent gait,<br/>
			Swift to revenge, but soon to share his fate;<br/>
			Brown, Adams, Coburn, falling side by side,<br/>
			Drench the chill sod with all their vital tide.</p>
			<p>Firm on the west bold Herkimer sustains<br/>
			The gather’d shock of all Canadia’s trains;<br/>
			Colons and wildmen post their skulkers there,<br/>
			Outflank his pickets and assail his rear,<br/>
			Drive in his distant scouts with hideous blare,<br/>
			And press, on three sides close, the hovering war.<br/>
			Johnson’s own shrieks commence the deafening din,<br/>
			Rouse every ambush and the storm begin.<br/>
			A thousand thickets, thro each opening glen,<br/>
			Pour forth their hunters to the chase of men;<br/>
			Trunks of huge trees, and rocks and ravines lend<br/>
			Unnumber’d batteries and their files defend;<br/>
			They fire, they squat, they rise, advance and fly,<br/>
			And yells and groans alternate rend the sky.<br/>
			The well aim’d hatchet cleaves the helmless head,<br/>
			Mute showers of arrows and loud storms of lead<br/>
			Rain thick from hands unseen, and sudden fling<br/>
			A deep confusion thro the laboring wing.</p>
			<p>But Herkimer undaunted quits the stand,<br/>
			Breaks in loose files his disencumbered band,<br/>
			Wheels on the howling glens each light-arm’d troop,<br/>
			And leads himself where Johnson tones his whoop,<br/>
			Pours thro his copse a well directed fire;<br/>
			The semisavage sees his tribes retire,<br/>
			Then follows thro the brush in full horse speed,<br/>
			And gains the hilltop where the Hurons lead;<br/>
			Here turns his courser; when a grateful sight<br/>
			Recals his stragglers, and restrains his flight.<br/>
			For Herkimer no longer now sustains<br/>
			The loss of blood that his faint vitals drains:<br/>
			A ball had pierced him ere he changed his field;<br/>
			The slow sure death his prudence had conceal’d,<br/>
			Till dark derouted foes should yield to flight,<br/>
			And his firm friends could finish well the fight.</p>
			<p>Lopt from his horse the hero sinks at last;<br/>
			The Hurons ken him, and with hallooing blast<br/>
			Shake the vast wilderness; the tribes around<br/>
			Drink with broad ears and swell the rending sound,<br/>
			Rush back to vengeance with tempestuous might,<br/>
			Sweep the long slopes from every neighboring height,<br/>
			Full on their check’d pursuers; who regain,<br/>
			From all their woods, the first contested plain.<br/>
			Here open fight begins; and sure defeat<br/>
			Had forced that column to a swift retreat,<br/>
			But Arnold, toiling thro the distant smoke,<br/>
			Beheld their plight, a small detachment took,<br/>
			Bore down behind them with his field-park loud,<br/>
			And hail’d his grapeshot thro the savage crowd;<br/>
			Strow’d every copse with dead, and chased afar<br/>
			The affrighted relics from the skirts of war.</p>
			<p>But on the centre swells the heaviest charge,<br/>
			The squares develop and the lines enlarge.<br/>
			Here Kosciusko’s mantling works conceal’d<br/>
			His batteries mute, but soon to scour the field;<br/>
			Morgan with all his marksmen flanks the foe,<br/>
			Hull, Brooks and Courtlandt in the vanguard glow;<br/>
			Here gallant Dearborn leads his light-arm’d train,<br/>
			Here Scammel towers, here Silly shakes the plain.</p>
			<p>Gates guides the onset with his waving brand,<br/>
			Assigns their task to each unfolding band,<br/>
			Sustains, inspirits, prompts the warrior’s rage,<br/>
			Now bids the flank and now the front engage,<br/>
			Points the stern riflers where their slugs to pour,<br/>
			And tells the unmasking batteries when to roar.<br/>
			For here impetuous Powell wheels and veers<br/>
			His royal guards, his British grenadiers;<br/>
			His Highland broadswords cut their wasting course,<br/>
			His horse-artillery whirls its furious force.<br/>
			Here Specht and Reidesel to battle bring<br/>
			Their scattering yagers from each folding wing;<br/>
			And here, concentred in tremendous might,<br/>
			Britain’s whole park, descending to the fight,<br/>
			Roars thro the ranks; ’tis Phillips leads the train,<br/>
			And toils and thunders o’er the shuddering plain.</p>
			<p>Burgoyne, secure of victory, from his height,<br/>
			Eyes the whole field and orders all the fight,<br/>
			Marks where his veterans plunge their fiercest fire,<br/>
			And where his foes seem halting to retire,<br/>
			Already sees the starry staff give way.<br/>
			And British ensigns gaining on the day;<br/>
			When from the western wing, in steely glare,<br/>
			All-conquering Arnold surged the tide of war.<br/>
			Columbia kindles as her hero comes;<br/>
			Her trump’s shrill clangor and her deafening drums<br/>
			Redoubling sound the charge; they rage, they burn,<br/>
			And hosted Europe trembles in her turn.<br/>
			So when Pelides’ absence check’d her fate,<br/>
			All Ilion issued from her guardian gate;<br/>
			Her huddling squadrons like a tempest pour’d,<br/>
			Each man a hero and each dart a sword,<br/>
			Full on retiring Greece tumultuous fall,<br/>
			And Greece reluctant seeks her sheltering wall;<br/>
			But Pelius’ son rebounding o’er the plain,<br/>
			Troy backward starts and seeks her towers again.</p>
			<p>Arnold’s dread falchion, with terrific sway,<br/>
			Rolls on the ranks and rules the doubtful day,<br/>
			Confounds with one wide sweep the astonish’d foes,<br/>
			And bids at last the scene of slaughter close.<br/>
			Pale rout begins, Britannia’s broken train<br/>
			Tread back their steps and scatter from the plain,<br/>
			To their strong camp precipitate retire,<br/>
			And wide behind them streams the roaring fire.</p>
			<p>Meantime, the skirts of war as Johnson gored,<br/>
			His kindred cannibals desert their lord;<br/>
			They scour the waste for undistinguish’d prey,<br/>
			Howl thro the night the horrors of the day,<br/>
			Scalp every straggler from all parties stray’d,<br/>
			Each wounded wanderer thro the moonlight glade;<br/>
			And while the absent armies give them place,<br/>
			Each camp they plunder and each world disgrace.</p>
			<p>One deed shall tell what fame great Albion draws<br/>
			From these auxiliars in her barbarous cause,<br/>
			Lucinda’s fate; the tale, ye nations, hear;<br/>
			Eternal ages, trace it with a tear.<br/>
			Long from the rampart, thro the imbattled field,<br/>
			She spied her Heartly where his column wheel’d,<br/>
			Traced him with steadfast eye and tortured breast,<br/>
			That heaved in concert with his dancing crest;<br/>
			And oft, with head advanced and hand outspread,<br/>
			Seem’d from her Love to ward the flying lead;<br/>
			Till, dimm’d by distance and the gathering cloud;<br/>
			At last he vanish’d in the warrior crowd.<br/>
			She thought he fell; and wild with fearless air,<br/>
			She left the camp to brave the woodland war,<br/>
			Made a long circuit, all her friends to shun,<br/>
			And wander’d wide beneath the falling sun;<br/>
			Then veering to the field, the pickets past,<br/>
			To gain the hillock where she miss’d him last.<br/>
			Fond maid, he rests not there; from finish’d fight<br/>
			He sought the camp, and closed the rear of flight.</p>
			<p>He hurries to his tent;⁠—oh rage! despair!<br/>
			No glimpse, no tidings of the frantic fair;<br/>
			Save that some carmen, as acamp they drove,<br/>
			Had seen her coursing for the western grove.<br/>
			Faint with fatigue and choked with burning thirst,<br/>
			Forth from his friends with bounding leap he burst,<br/>
			Vaults o’er the palisade with eyes on flame,<br/>
			And fills the welkin with Lucinda’s name,<br/>
			Swift thro the wild wood paths phrenetic springs⁠—<br/>
			Lucind! Lucinda! thro the wild wood rings.<br/>
			All night he wanders; barking wolves alone<br/>
			And screaming night-birds answer to his moan;<br/>
			For war had roused them from their savage den;<br/>
			They scent the field, they snuff the walks of men.</p>
			<p>The fair one too, of every aid forlorn,<br/>
			Had raved and wander’d, till officipus morn<br/>
			Awaked the Mohawks from their short repose,<br/>
			To glean the plunder, ere their comrades rose.<br/>
			Two Mohawks met the maid⁠—historian, hold!⁠—<br/>
			Poor Human Nature! must thy shame be told?<br/>
			Where then that proud preeminence of birth,<br/>
			Thy Moral Sense? the brightest boast of earth.<br/>
			Had but the tiger changed his heart for thine,<br/>
			Could rocks their bowels with that heart combine,<br/>
			Thy tear had gusht, thy hand relieved her pain,<br/>
			And led Lucinda to her lord again.</p>
			<p>She starts, with eyes upturn’d and fleeting breath,<br/>
			In their raised axes views her instant death,<br/>
			Spreads her white hands to heaven in frantic prayer,<br/>
			Then runs to grasp their knees, and crouches there.<br/>
			Her hair, half lost along the shrubs she past,<br/>
			Rolls in loose tangles round her lovely waist;<br/>
			Her kerchief torn betrays the globes of snow<br/>
			That heave responsive to her weight of woe.<br/>
			Does all this eloquence suspend the knife?<br/>
			Does no superior bribe contest her life?<br/>
			There does: the scalps by British gold are paid;<br/>
			A long-hair’d scalp adorns that heavenly head;<br/>
			Arid comes the sacred spoil from friend or foe,<br/>
			No marks distinguish, and no man can know.</p>
			<p>With calculating pause and demon grin,<br/>
			They seize her hands, and thro her face divine<br/>
			Drive the descending ax; the shriek she sent<br/>
			Attain’d her lover’s ear; he thither bent<br/>
			With all the speed his wearied limbs could yield,<br/>
			Whirl’d his keen blade, and stretch’d upon the field<br/>
			The yelling fiends; who there disputing stood<br/>
			Her gory scalp, their horrid prize of blood.<br/>
			He sunk delirious on her lifeless clay,<br/>
			And past, in starts of sense, the dreadful day.</p>
			<p>Are these thy trophies, Carleton! these the swords<br/>
			Thy hand unsheath’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> and gave the savage hordes,<br/>
			Thy boasted friends, by treaties brought from far,<br/>
			To aid thy master in his murderous war?</p>
			<p>But now Britannia’s chief, with proud disdain<br/>
			Coop’d in his camp, demands the field again.<br/>
			Back to their fate his splendid host he drew,<br/>
			Swell’d high their rage, and led the charge anew;<br/>
			Again the batteries roar, the lightnings play,<br/>
			Again they fall, again they roll away;<br/>
			For now Columbia, with rebounding might,<br/>
			Foil’d quick their columns, but confined their flight.<br/>
			Her wings, like fierce tornados, gyring ran,<br/>
			Crusht their wide flanks and gain’d their flying van;<br/>
			Here Arnold charged; the hero storm’d and pour’d<br/>
			A thousand thunders where he turn’<br/>
			No pause, no parley; onward far he fray’d,<br/>
			Dispersed whole squadrons every bound he made,<br/>
			Broke thro their rampart, seized theircampand stores<br/>
			And pluck’d the standard from their broken towers.</p>
			<p>Aghast, confounded in the midway field,<br/>
			They drop their arms; the banded nations yield.<br/>
			When sad Burgoyne, in one disastrous day,<br/>
			Sees future crowns and former wreaths decay,<br/>
			His banners furl’d, his long battalions wheel’d<br/>
			To pile their muskets on the battle field;<br/>
			While two pacific armies shade one plain,<br/>
			The mighty victors and the captive train.</p>
