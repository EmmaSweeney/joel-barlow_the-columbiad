			<p>In one dark age, beneath a single hand,<br/>
			Thus rose an empire in the savage land.<br/>
			Its wealth and power with following years increase,<br/>
			Its growing nations spread the walks of peace;<br/>
			Religion here, that universal name,<br/>
			Man’s proudest passion, most ungovern’d flame,<br/>
			Erects her altars on the same bright base,<br/>
			That dazzled erst, and still deludes the race;<br/>
			Sun, moon, all powers that forceful strike his eyes,<br/>
			Earth-shaking storms and constellated skies.</p>
			<p>Yet all the pomp his labors here unfold,<br/>
			The vales of verdure and the towers of gold,<br/>
			Those infant arts and sovereign seats of state,<br/>
			In short-lived glory hasten to their fate.<br/>
			Thy followers, rushing like an angry flood,<br/>
			Too soon shall drench them in the nation’s blood;<br/>
			Nor thou, Las Casas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a> best of men, shalt stay<br/>
			The ravening legions from their guardless prey.<br/>
			O hapless prelate! hero, saint and sage,<br/>
			Foredoom’d with crimes a fruitless war to wage,<br/>
			To see at last (thy life of virtue run)<br/>
			A realm unpeopled and a world undone!<br/>
			While pious Valverde mock of priesthood stands,<br/>
			Guilt in his heart, the gospel in his hands,<br/>
			Bids, in one field, their unarm’d thousands bleed,<br/>
			Smiles o’er the scene and sanctifies the deed.<br/>
			And thou, brave Gasca, with persuasive strain,<br/>
			Shalt lift thy voice and urge thy power in vain;<br/>
			Vain are thy hopes the sinking land to save,<br/>
			Or call her slaughter’d millions from the grave.</p>
			<p>Here Hesper paused. Columbus with a sigh<br/>
			Cast o’er the continent his moisten’d eye,<br/>
			And thus replied: Ah, hide me in the tomb;<br/>
			Why should I live to see the impending doom?<br/>
			If such foul deeds the scheme of heaven compose,<br/>
			And virtue’s toils induce redoubled woes,<br/>
			Unfold no more; but grant a kind release;<br/>
			Give me, ’tis all I ask, to rest in peace.</p>
			<p>And thou shalt rest in peace, the Saint rejoin’d,<br/>
			Ere these conflicting shades involve mankind.<br/>
			But broader views shall first thy mind engage,<br/>
			Years far advanced beyond this darksome age<br/>
			Shall feast thee here; the fruits of thy long care<br/>
			A grateful world beneath thy ken shall share.<br/>
			Europe’s contending kings shall soon behold<br/>
			These fertile plains and hills of treasured gold;<br/>
			And in the path of thy adventurous sail<br/>
			Their countless navies float on every gale,<br/>
			For wealth and commerce search the western shore.<br/>
			And load each ocean with the shining ore.</p>
			<p>As up the orient heaven the dawning ray<br/>
			Smiles o’er the hills and gives the promised day,<br/>
			Drives fraud and rapine from their nightly spoil,<br/>
			And social nature wakes to various toil;<br/>
			So from the blazing mine the golden store<br/>
			Mid rival states shall spread from shore to shore,<br/>
			Unite their force, its opulence to share,<br/>
			Extend the pomp but sooth the rage of war;<br/>
			Wide thro the world while genius unconfined<br/>
			Tempts loftier flights, and opens all the mind,<br/>
			Dissolves the slavish bands of monkish lore,<br/>
			Wakes the bold arts and bids the Muses soar.<br/>
			Then shall thy northern climes their seats display<br/>
			United nations there commence their sway;<br/>
			O’er earth and ocean spread their peerless fame,<br/>
			And send thro time thy patriarchal name.</p>
			<p>Now turn thy view to Europe; see the rage<br/>
			Of feudal faction every court engage;<br/>
			All honest labor, all commercial ties<br/>
			Their kings discountenance, their lords despise.<br/>
			The naked harbors, looking to the main,<br/>
			Rear their kind cliffs and break the storms in vain,<br/>
			The willing wave no foreign treasures lade,<br/>
			Nor sails nor cities cast a watery shade;<br/>
			Save, where yon opening gulph the strand divides,<br/>
			Proud Venice bathes her in the broken tides,<br/>
			Weds her tamed sea, shakes every distant throne,<br/>
			And deems by right the naval world her own.</p>
			<p>Yet must we mark, the bondage of the mind<br/>
			Spreads deeper glooms, and subj ugates mankind;<br/>
			The zealots fierce, whom local creeds enrage,<br/>
			In holy feuds perpetual combat wage,<br/>
			Support all crimes by full indulgence given,<br/>
			Usurp the power and wield the sword of heaven,</p>
			<p>But lo, where future years their scenes unrol,<br/>
			The rising arts inspire the venturous soul.<br/>
			From all the ports that cleave the coast of Spain,<br/>
			New fleets ascending streak the western main;<br/>
			From Tago’s bank, from Albion’s rocky round,<br/>
			Commercing squadrons o’er the billows bound;<br/>
			Thro Afric’s isles observe the sweeping sails,<br/>
			Full pinions tossing in Arabian gales,<br/>
			Indus and Ganges deep in canvass lost,<br/>
			And navies crowding round Cambodia’s coast;<br/>
			New nations rise, all climes and oceans brave,<br/>
			And shade with sheets the immeasurable wave.</p>
			<p>See lofty Ximenes with solemn gait<br/>
			Move from the cloister to the walks of state,<br/>
			And thro the factious monarchies of Spain,<br/>
			Curb the fierce lords and fix one royal reign.<br/>
			Behold dread Charles the imperial seat ascends,<br/>
			O’er Europe’s thrones his conquering arm extends;<br/>
			While wealthier shores, beneath the western day,<br/>
			Unfold their treasures to confirm his sway.</p>
			<p>Roused at false glory’s fascinating call,<br/>
			See Francis train the gallant youths of Gaul,<br/>
			O’erstrain the strength of her extended states,<br/>
			Scale the proud Alps, or burst their granite gates,<br/>
			On Pavia’s plain for Cesar’s crown contend,<br/>
			Of arms the votary, but of arts the friend.</p>
			<p>And see proud Wolsey rise, securely great,<br/>
			Kings at his call and mitres round him wait;<br/>
			From monkish walls the hoarded wealth he draws<br/>
			To aid the tyrant and restrain the laws,<br/>
			Wakes Albion’s genius, neighboring princes braves,<br/>
			And shares with them the commonwealth of waves,</p>
			<p>Behold dark Solyman, from eastern skies,<br/>
			With his grim host magnificently rise,<br/>
			Wave his broad crescent o’er the Midland sea,<br/>
			Thro vast Hungaria drive his conquering way,<br/>
			Crowd close the Christian powers, and carry far<br/>
			The rules of homicide, the lore of war.</p>
			<p>The Tuscan dukes excite a nobler strife;<br/>
			Lorenzo calls the Fine Arts forth to life,<br/>
			Fair nature’s mimic maids; whose powers divine<br/>
			Her charms develop and her laws define;<br/>
			From sire to son the splendid labors spread,<br/>
			And Leo follows where good Cosmo led.<br/>
			Waked from the ground that Gothic rovers trod,<br/>
			Starts the bronze hero and the marble god;<br/>
			Monks, prelates, pontiffs pay the reverence due<br/>
			To that bold taste their Grecian masters knew;<br/>
			Resurgent temples throng the Latian shore,<br/>
			The Pencil triumphs and the Muses soar.</p>
			<p>O’er the dark world Erasmus rears his eye,<br/>
			In schoolman lore sees kings and nations lie,<br/>
			With strength of judgment and with fancy warm,<br/>
			Derides their follies and dissolves the charm,<br/>
			Tears the deep veil that bigot zeal has thrown<br/>
			On pagan books and science long unknown,<br/>
			From faith in senseless rites relieves mankind,<br/>
			And seats bold virtue in the conscious mind.<br/>
			But still the frightful task, to face alone<br/>
			The jealous vengeance of the papal throne,<br/>
			Restrains his hand: he gives the contest o’er,<br/>
			And leaves his hardier sons to curb that power.</p>
			<p>Luther walks forth in yon majestic frame,<br/>
			Bright beam of heaven, and heir of endless fame,<br/>
			Born, like thyself, thro toils and griefs to wind,<br/>
			From slavery’s chains to free the captive mind,<br/>
			Brave adverse crowns, control the pontiff sway,<br/>
			And bring benighted nations into day.</p>
			<p>Remark what crowds his name around him brings,<br/>
			Schools, synods, prelates, potentates and kings,<br/>
			All gaining knowledge from his boundless store,<br/>
			And join’d to shield him from the papal power.<br/>
			First of his friends,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a> see Frederic’s princely form<br/>
			Ward from the sage divine the gathering storm,<br/>
			In learned Wittemburgh secure his seat,<br/>
			High throne of thought, religion’s safe retreat.<br/>
			There sits Melancthon, mild as morning light,<br/>
			And feuds, tho sacred, soften in his sight;<br/>
			In terms so gentle flows his tuneful tongue,<br/>
			Even cloister’d bigots join the pupil throng;<br/>
			By all sectarian chiefs he lives approved,<br/>
			By monarchs courted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> and by men beloved.</p>
			<p>And lo, where Europe’s utmost limits bend,<br/>
			From this new source what various lights ascend!<br/>
			See haughty Henry from the papal tie<br/>
			His realms dissever, and the priest defy;<br/>
			While Albion’s sons disdain a foreign throne,<br/>
			And learn to bound the oppressions of their own.</p>
			<p>Then rises Loyola, a strange new name,<br/>
			By paths unseen to reach the goal of fame;<br/>
			Thro courts and camps he teaches how to wind,<br/>
			To mine whole states and overreach mankind.<br/>
			Train’d in his school, a bold and artful race<br/>
			Range o’er the world, and every sect embrace,<br/>
			All creeds and powers and policies explore,<br/>
			New seats of science raise on every shore;<br/>
			Till their wide empire gains a wondrous birth,<br/>
			Built in all empires o’er this ancient earth.<br/>
			Our wildmen too, the tribes of Paraguay,<br/>
			Receive their rites and bow beneath their sway.</p>
			<p>The world of men thus moving in thy view<br/>
			Improve their state, more useful works pursue;<br/>
			Unwonted deeds in rival greatness shine,<br/>
			Call’d into life, and first inspired by thine.<br/>
			So while imperial Homer tunes the lyre,<br/>
			His living lays unnumber’d bards inspire;<br/>
			From age to age the kindling spirit flies,<br/>
			Sounds thro the earth and echoes to the skies.</p>
			<p>Now roll the years, when Europe’s ample space<br/>
			By peace and culture rears a wiser race,<br/>
			Men bred to labor, school’d in freedom’s lore,<br/>
			And formed to colonize our favorite shore.<br/>
			To speed their course, the sons of bigot rage<br/>
			In persecution whelm the inquiring age;<br/>
			Myriads of martyr’d heroes mount the pyre,<br/>
			And blind devotion lights the sacred fire.</p>
			<p>Led by the dark Dominicans of Spain,<br/>
			A newborn Fury walks the wide domain,<br/>
			Gaunt <strong>Inquisition</strong>; mark her giant stride,<br/>
			Her blood-nursed vulture screaming at her side.<br/>
			Her priestly train the tools of torment brings.<br/>
			Racks, wheels and crosses, faggots, stakes and strings;<br/>
			Scaffolds and cages round her altar stand,<br/>
			And, tipt with sulphur, waves her flaming brand.<br/>
			Her imps of inquest round the Fiend advance,<br/>
			Suspectors grave, and spies with eye askance,<br/>
			Pretended heretics who worm the soul,<br/>
			And sly confessors with their secret scroll,<br/>
			Accusers hired, for each conviction paid,<br/>
			Judges retain’d and witnesses by trade.</p>
			<p>Dragged from a thousand jails her victim trains,<br/>
			Jews, Moors and Christians, clank alike their chains,<br/>
			Read their known sentence in her fiery eyes,<br/>
			And breathe to heaven their unavailing cries;<br/>
			Lash’d on the pile their writhing bodies turn,<br/>
			And, veil’d in doubling smoke, begin to burn.<br/>
			Where the flames open, lo! their limbs in vain<br/>
			Reach out for help, distorted by the pain;<br/>
			Till folded in the fires they disappear,<br/>
			And not a sound invades the startled ear.</p>
			<p>See Philip, throned in insolence and pride,<br/>
			Enjoy their wailings and their pangs deride;<br/>
			While o’er the same dread scenes, on Albion’s isles,<br/>
			His well-taught spouse, the cruel Mary, smiles.<br/>
			What clouds of smoke hang heavy round the shore!<br/>
			What altars hecatomb’d with Christian gore!<br/>
			Her sire’s best friends, the wise, the brave, the good,<br/>
			Roll in the flames or fly the land of blood.</p>
			<p>To Gallia’s plains the maddening phrensy turns.<br/>
			Religion raves and civil discord burns;<br/>
			Leaguers and Huguenots their vengeance pour,<br/>
			They swell Bartholemy’s wide feast of gore,<br/>
			Alternate victors bid their gibbets rise,<br/>
			And the foul stench of victims chokes the skies.</p>
			<p>Now cease the factions with the Valois line,<br/>
			And Bourbon’s virtues every voice combine.<br/>
			Quell’d by his fame, the furious sects accord,<br/>
			Europe respires beneath his guardian sword;<br/>
			Batavia’s states to independence soar,<br/>
			And curb the cohorts of Iberian power.<br/>
			From Albion’s ports her infant navies heave,<br/>
			Stretch forth and thunder on the Flandrian wave;<br/>
			Her Howard there first foils the force of Spain,<br/>
			And there begins her mastery of the main.</p>
			<p>The Seraph spoke; when full beneath their eye<br/>
			A new-form’d squadron rose along the sky.<br/>
			High on the tallest deck majestic shone<br/>
			Sage Raleigh, pointing to the western sun;<br/>
			His eye, bent forward, ardent and sublime,<br/>
			Seem’d piercing nature and evolving time;<br/>
			Beside him stood a globe, whose figures traced<br/>
			A future empire in each present waste;<br/>
			All former works of men behind him shone<br/>
			Graved by his hand in ever-during stone;<br/>
			On his calm brow a various crown displays<br/>
			The hero’s laurel and the scholar’s bays;<br/>
			His graceful limbs in steely mail were drest,<br/>
			The bright star burning on his lofty breast;<br/>
			His sword, high waving, flash’d the solar ray.<br/>
			Illumed the shrouds and rainbow’d far the spray;<br/>
			The smiling crew rose resolute and brave,<br/>
			And the glad sails hung bounding o’er the wave.</p>
			<p>Storms of wild Hatteras, suspend your roar,<br/>
			Ye tumbling billows, cease to shake the shore;<br/>
			Look thro the doubling clouds, thou lamp of day,<br/>
			Teach the bold Argonauts their chartless way;<br/>
			Your viewless capes, broad Chesapeak, unfold,<br/>
			And show your promised Colchis fleeced with gold.<br/>
			No plundering squadron your new Jason brings;<br/>
			No pirate demigods nor hordes of kings<br/>
			From shore to shore a faithless miscreant steers,<br/>
			To steal a maid and leave a sire in tears.<br/>
			But yon wise chief conducts with careful ken<br/>
			The queen of colonies, the best of men,<br/>
			To wake to fruitful life your slumbering soil,<br/>
			And rear an empire with the hand of toil.<br/>
			Your fond Medea too, whose dauntless breast<br/>
			All danger braves to screen her hunted guest.<br/>
			Shall quit her native tribe, but never share<br/>
			The crimes and sufferings of the Colchian fair.<br/>
			Blest Pocahontas! fear no lurking guile;<br/>
			Thy hero’s love shall well reward thy smile.<br/>
			Ah sooth the wanderer in his desperate plight,<br/>
			Hide him by day and calm his cares by night;<br/>
			Tho savage nations with thy vengeful sire<br/>
			Pursue their victim with unceasing ire,<br/>
			And tho their threats thy startled ear assail,<br/>
			Let virtue’s voice o’er filial fears prevail.<br/>
			Fly with the faithful youth, his steps to guide,<br/>
			Pierce the known thicket, breast the fordless tide,<br/>
			Illude the scout, avoid the ambush’d line,<br/>
			And lead him safely to his friends and thine;<br/>
			For thine shall be his friends, his heart, his name;<br/>
			His camp shall shout, his nation boast thy fame.</p>
			<p>But now the Bay unfolds a passage wide,<br/>
			And leads the squadron up the freshening tide;<br/>
			Where Pohatan spreads deep her sylvan soil,<br/>
			And grassy lawns allure the steps of toil.<br/>
			Here, lodged in peace, they tread the welcome land.<br/>
			An instant harvest waves beneath their hand,<br/>
			Spontaneous fruits their easy cares beguile,<br/>
			And opening fields in living culture smile.</p>
			<p>With joy Columbus view’d; when thus his voice:<br/>
			Ye grove-clad shores, ye generous hosts, rejoice!<br/>
			Exchange your benefits, your gifts combine;<br/>
			What nature fashions, let her sons refine.</p>
			<p>Be thou, my Seer, the people’s guardian friend,<br/>
			Protect their virtues and their lives defend;<br/>
			May wealth and wisdom with their arts unfold,<br/>
			Yet save, oh, save them from the thirst of gold!<br/>
			Let the poor guardless natives never feel<br/>
			The flamen’s fraud, the soldier’s fateful steel;<br/>
			But learn the blessings that alone attend<br/>
			On civil rights where social virtues blend,<br/>
			In these brave leaders find a welcome guide,<br/>
			And rear their fanes and empires by their side.<br/>
			Smile, great Hesperia, smile; the star of morn<br/>
			Illumes thy heavens and bids thy day be born;<br/>
			Thy opening forests show the work begun,<br/>
			Thy plains unshaded drink a purer sun;<br/>
			Yield now thy bounties, load the laboring main,<br/>
			Give birth to nations, and begin thy reign.</p>
			<p>The Hero spoke; when thus the Saint rejoin’d,<br/>
			Approved his joy, and feasted still his mind:<br/>
			Well may thy voice, with patriarch pride elate,<br/>
			Burst forth triumphant at a scene so great;<br/>
			Here springs indeed the day, since time began,<br/>
			The brightest, broadest, happiest morn of man.<br/>
			In these prime settlements thy raptures trace<br/>
			The germ, the genius of a sapient race,<br/>
			Predestined here to methodise and mould<br/>
			New codes of empire to reform the old.</p>
			<p>A work so vast a second world required,<br/>
			By oceans bourn’d, from elder states retired;<br/>
			Where, uncontaminated, unconfined,<br/>
			Free contemplation might expand the mind,<br/>
			To form, fix, prove the well-adjusted plan,<br/>
			And base and build the commonwealth of man.</p>
			<p>This arm, that leads the stellar host of even,<br/>
			That stretch’d o’er yon rude ridge the western heaven,<br/>
			That heal’d the wounded earth, when from her side<br/>
			The moon burst forth, and left the South Sea tide,<br/>
			That calm’d these elements, and taught them where<br/>
			To mould their mass and rib the crusted sphere,<br/>
			Line the closed continent with wrecks of life,<br/>
			And recommence their generating strife,<br/>
			That rear’d the mountain, spread the subject plain,<br/>
			Led the long stream and roll’d the billowy main,<br/>
			Stole from retiring tides the growing strand,<br/>
			Heaved the green banks, the shadowy inlets plann’d,<br/>
			Strow’d the wild fruitage, gave the beast his place,<br/>
			And form’d the region for thy filial race⁠—<br/>
			This arm prepared their future seats of state,<br/>
			Design’d their limits and prescribed their date.</p>
			<p>When first the staggering globe its breach repair’d,<br/>
			And this bold hemisphere its shoulders rear’d,<br/>
			Back to those heights, whose hovering vapor shrouds<br/>
			My rock-raised world in Alleganian clouds,<br/>
			The Atlantic waste its coral kingdom spread,<br/>
			And scaly nations here their gambols led;<br/>
			Till by degrees, thro following tracts of time,<br/>
			From laboring ocean rose the sedgy clime,<br/>
			As from unloaded waves the rising sand<br/>
			Swell’d into light and gently drew to land.<br/>
			For, moved by trade winds o’er the flaming zone,<br/>
			The waves roll westward with the constant sun,<br/>
			Meet my firm isthmus, scoop that gulphy bed,<br/>
			Wheel to the north, and here their current spread.<br/>
			Those ravaged banks, that move beneath their force,<br/>
			Borne on the tide and lost along their course,<br/>
			Create the shore, consolidate the soil.<br/>
			And hither lead the enlighten’d steps of toil.</p>
			<p>Think not the lust of gold shall here annoy,<br/>
			Enslave the nation and its nerve destroy.<br/>
			No useles mine these northern hills enclose,<br/>
			No ruby ripens and no diamond glows;<br/>
			But richer stores and rocks of useful mould<br/>
			Repay in wealth the penury of gold.<br/>
			Freedom’s unconquer’d race, with healthy toil,<br/>
			Shall lop the grove and warm the furrow’d soil,<br/>
			From iron ridges break the rugged ore,<br/>
			And plant with men the man-ennobling shore;<br/>
			Sails, villas, towers and temples round them heave,<br/>
			Shine o’er the realms and light the distant wave.<br/>
			Nor think the native tribes shall rue the day<br/>
			That leads our heroes o’er the watery way.<br/>
			A cause like theirs no mean device can mar,<br/>
			Nor bigot rage nor sacerdotal war.<br/>
			From eastern tyrants driven, resolved and brave,<br/>
			To build new states or seek a distant grave,<br/>
			Our sons shall try a new colonial plan,<br/>
			To tame the soil, but spare their kindred man.</p>
			<p>Thro Europe’s wilds when feudal nations spread.<br/>
			The pride of conquest every legion led.<br/>
			Each fur-clad chief, by servile crowds adored,<br/>
			O’er conquer’d realms assumed the name of lord,<br/>
			Built the proud castle, ranged the savage wood,<br/>
			Fired his grim host to frequent fields of blood,<br/>
			With new-made honors lured his subject bands,<br/>
			Price of their lives, and purchase of their lands;<br/>
			For names and titles bade the world resign<br/>
			Their faith, their freedom and their rights divine.</p>
			<p>Contending baronies their terrors spread,<br/>
			And slavery follow’d where the standard led;<br/>
			Till, little tyrants by the great o’erthrown,<br/>
			The spoils of nobles build the regal crown;<br/>
			Wealth, wisdom, virtue, every claim of man<br/>
			Unguarded fall to consummate the plan.<br/>
			Ambitious cares, that nature never gave,<br/>
			Torment alike the monarch and the slave,<br/>
			Thro all degrees in gradual pomp ascend,<br/>
			Honor the name, but tyranny the end.</p>
			<p>Far different honors here the heart shall claim,<br/>
			Sublimer objects, deeds of happier fame;<br/>
			A new creation waits the western shore,<br/>
			And moral triumphs o’er monarchic power.<br/>
			Thy freeborn sons, with genius unconfined,<br/>
			Nor sloth can slacken nor a tyrant bind;<br/>
			With self-wrought fame and worth internal blest,<br/>
			No venal star shall brighten on their breast,<br/>
			Nor king-created name nor courtly art<br/>
			Damp the bold thought or desiccate the heart.<br/>
			Above all fraud, beyond all titles great,<br/>
			Truth in their voice and sceptres at their feet,<br/>
			Like sires of unborn states they move sublime,<br/>
			Look empires thro and span the breadth of time,<br/>
			Hold o’er the world, that men may choose from far,<br/>
			The palm of peace, or scourge of barbarous war;<br/>
			Till their example every nation charms,<br/>
			Commands its friendship and its rage disarms.</p>
			<p>Here social man a second birth shall find,<br/>
			And a new range of reason lift his mind,<br/>
			Feed his strong intellect with purer light,<br/>
			A nobler sense of duty and of right,<br/>
			The sense of liberty; whose holy fire<br/>
			His life shall temper and his laws inspire,<br/>
			Purge from all shades the world-embracing scope<br/>
			That prompts his genius and expands his hope.</p>
			<p>When first his form arose erect on earth,<br/>
			Parturient nature hail’d the wondrous birth,<br/>
			With fairest limbs and finest fibres wrought,<br/>
			And framed for vast and various toils of thought.<br/>
			To aid his promised powers with loftier flight,<br/>
			And stretch his views beyond corporeal sight,<br/>
			Prometheus came, and from the floods of day<br/>
			Sunn’d his clear soul with heaven’s internal ray,<br/>
			The expanding spark divine; that round him springs,<br/>
			And leads and lights him thro the immense of things,<br/>
			Probes the dense earth, explores the soundless main,<br/>
			Remoulds their mass thro all its threefold reign,<br/>
			O’er great, o’er small extends his physic laws,<br/>
			Empalms the empyrean or dissects a gaz,<br/>
			Weighs the vast orbs of heaven, bestrides the sky,<br/>
			Walks on the windows of an insect’s eye;<br/>
			Turns then to self, more curious still to trace<br/>
			The whirls of passion that involve the race,<br/>
			That cloud with mist the visual lamp of God,<br/>
			And plunge the poniard in fraternal blood.<br/>
			Here fails his light. The proud Titanian ray<br/>
			O’er physic nature sheds indeed its day;<br/>
			Yet leaves the moral in chaotic jars,<br/>
			The spoil of violence, the sport of wars,<br/>
			Presents contrasted parts of one great plan,<br/>
			Earth, heaven subdued, but man at swords with man;<br/>
			His wars, his errors into science grown,<br/>
			And the great cause of all his ills unknown.</p>
			<p>But when he steps on these regenerate shores,<br/>
			His mind unfolding for superior powers,<br/>
			<strong>Freedom</strong>, his new Prometheus, here shall rise,<br/>
			Light her new torch in my refulgent skies,<br/>
			Touch with a stronger life his opening soul,<br/>
			Of moral systems fix the central goal,<br/>
			Her own resplendent essence. Thence expand<br/>
			The rays of reason that illume the land;<br/>
			Thence equal rights proceed, and equal laws,<br/>
			Thence holy Justice all her reverence draws;<br/>
			Truth with untarnish’d beam descending thence,<br/>
			Strikes every eye, and quickens every sense,<br/>
			Bids bright Instruction spread her ample page,<br/>
			To drive dark dogmas from the inquiring age,<br/>
			Ope the true treasures of the earth and skies,<br/>
			And teach the student where his object lies.</p>
			<p>Sun of the moral world! effulgent source<br/>
			Of man’s best wisdom and his steadiest force,<br/>
			Soul-searching Freedom! here assume thy stand,<br/>
			And radiate hence to every distant land;<br/>
			Point out and prove how all the scenes of strife,<br/>
			The shock of states, the impassion’d broils of life,<br/>
			Spring from unequal sway; and how they fly<br/>
			Before the splendor of thy peaceful eye;<br/>
			Unfold at last the genuine social plan,<br/>
			The mind’s full scope, the dignity of man,<br/>
			Bold nature bursting thro her long disguise,<br/>
			And nations daring to be just and wise.</p>
			<p>Yes! righteous Freedom, heaven and earth and sea<br/>
			Yield or withold their various gifts for thee;<br/>
			Protected Industry beneath thy reign<br/>
			Leads all the virtues in her filial train;<br/>
			Courageous Probity with brow serene,<br/>
			And Temperance calm presents her placid mien<br/>
			Contentment, Moderation, Labor, Art,<br/>
			Mould the new man and humanize his heart;<br/>
			To public plenty private ease dilates,<br/>
			Domestic peace to harmony of states.<br/>
			Protected Industry, careering far,<br/>
			Detects the cause and cures the rage of war,<br/>
			And sweeps, with forceful arm, to their last graves,<br/>
			Kings from the earth and pirates from the waves.</p>
			<p>But slow proceeds the work. Long toils, my son,<br/>
			Must base the fabric of so vast a throne;<br/>
			Where Freedom founds her everlasting reign,<br/>
			And earth’s whole empires form the fair domain.<br/>
			That great coloniarch, whose exalted soul<br/>
			Pervades all scenes that future years unrol,<br/>
			Must yield the palm, and at a courtier’s shrine<br/>
			His plans relinquish and his life resign;<br/>
			His life that brightens, as his death shall stain,<br/>
			The fair, foul annals of his master’s reign.</p>
			<p>That feeble band, the lonely wilds who tread,<br/>
			Their sire, their genius in their Raleigh dead,<br/>
			Shall pine and perish in the savage gloom,<br/>
			Or mount the wave and seek their ancient home.<br/>
			Others in vain the generous task pursue,<br/>
			The dangers tempt and all the strife renew;<br/>
			While kings and ministers obstruct<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> the plan,<br/>
			Unfaithful guardians of the weal of man.</p>
			<p>At last brave Delaware, with his blithe host,<br/>
			Sails in full triumph to the well-known coast,<br/>
			Aids with a liberal hand the patriot cause,<br/>
			Reforms their policy, designs their laws;<br/>
			Till o’er Virginia’s plains they spread their sway,<br/>
			And push their hamlets tow’rd the setting day.<br/>
			He comes, my Delaware! how mild and bland<br/>
			My zephyrs greet him from the long-sought land!<br/>
			From fluvial glades that thro my cantons run,<br/>
			From those rich mounds that mask the falling sun.</p>
			<p>Borne up my Chesapeak, as first he hails<br/>
			The flowery banks that scent his slackening sails,<br/>
			Descending twilight mellows down the gleam<br/>
			That spreads far forward on the broad blue stream;<br/>
			The moonbeam dancing, as the pendants glide,<br/>
			Silvers with trembling tints the ripply tide;<br/>
			The sand-sown beach, the rocky bluff repays<br/>
			The faint effulgence with their amber’d rays;<br/>
			O’er greenwood glens a browner lustre flies,<br/>
			And bright-hair’d hills walk shadowy round the skies.</p>
			<p>Profound solicitude and strong delight<br/>
			Absorb the chief, as thro the waste of night<br/>
			He walks the lonely deck, and skirts the lands<br/>
			That wait their nations from his guiding hands.<br/>
			Tall thro the tide the river Sires by turns<br/>
			Rise round the bark and blend their social urns;<br/>
			Majestic brotherhood! each feels the power<br/>
			To feed an empire from his future store.<br/>
			They stand stupendous, flooding full the bay,<br/>
			And pointing each thro different climes the way.</p>
			<p>Resplendent o’er the rest, the regent god<br/>
			Potowmak towers, and sways the swelling flood;<br/>
			Vines clothe his arms, wild fruits o’erfill his horn,<br/>
			Wreaths of green maize his reverend brows adorn,<br/>
			His silver beard reflects the lunar day,<br/>
			And round his loins the scaly nations play.<br/>
			The breeze falls calm, the sails in silence rest,<br/>
			While thus his greetings cheer the stranger guest:</p>
			<p>Blest be the bark that seized the promised hour<br/>
			To waft thee welcome to this friendly shore!<br/>
			Long have we learnt the fame that here awaits<br/>
			The future sires of our unplanted states;<br/>
			We all salute thee with our mingling tides,<br/>
			Our high-fenced havens and our fruitful sides.<br/>
			The hundred realms our myriad fountains drain<br/>
			Shall lose their limits in the vast domain;<br/>
			But my bold banks with proud impatience wait<br/>
			The palm of glory in a work so great;<br/>
			On me thy sons their central seat shall raise,<br/>
			And crown my labors with distinguish’d praise.<br/>
			For this, from rock-ribb’d lakes I forced my birth,<br/>
			And climb’d and sunder’d many a mound of earth,<br/>
			Rent the huge hills that yonder heave on high<br/>
			And with their tenfold ridges rake the sky,<br/>
			Removed whole mountains in my headlong way,<br/>
			Strow’d a strong soil around this branching Bay,<br/>
			Scoop’d wide his basins to the distant main,<br/>
			And hung with headlands every marsh they drain.</p>
			<p>Haste then, my heroes, tempt the fearless toil,<br/>
			Enrich your nations with the nurturing spoil;<br/>
			O’er my vast vales let yellow harvests wave,<br/>
			Quay the calm ports and dike the lawns I lave.<br/>
			Win from the waters every stagnant fen,<br/>
			Where truant rills escape my conscious ken;<br/>
			And break those remnant rocks that still impede<br/>
			My current crowding thro the gaps I made.</p>
			<p>So shall your barks pursue my branching bed,<br/>
			Slope after slope, to every fountain’s head,<br/>
			Seat your contiguous towns on all my shores,<br/>
			And charge my channel with their seaward stores.<br/>
			Freedom and Peace shall well reward your care,<br/>
			My guardian mounds protect the friendly pair;<br/>
			Or if delirious War shall dare draw nigh,<br/>
			And eastern storms o’ercast the western sky,<br/>
			My soil shall rear the chief to guide your host,<br/>
			And drive the demon cringing from the coast;<br/>
			Yon verdant hill his sylvan seat shall claim,<br/>
			And grow immortal from his deathless fame.</p>
			<p>Then shall your federal towers my bank adorn,<br/>
			And hail with me the great millennial morn<br/>
			That gilds your capitol. Thence earth shall draw<br/>
			Her first clear codes of liberty and law;<br/>
			There public right a settled form shall find,<br/>
			Truth trim her lamp to lighten humankind,<br/>
			Old Afric’s sons their shameful fetters cast,<br/>
			Our wild Hesperians humanize at last,<br/>
			All men participate, all time expand<br/>
			The source of good my liberal sages plann’d.</p>
			<p>This said, he plunges in the sacred flood;<br/>
			That closes calm and lulls the cradled god.<br/>
			Exulting at his words, the gallant crew<br/>
			Brace the broad canvass and their course pursue:<br/>
			For now the breathing airs, from ocean born,<br/>
			Breeze up the bay, and lead the lively morn<br/>
			That lights them to their port. ’Tis here they join<br/>
			Their bold precursors in the work divine;<br/>
			And here their followers, yet a numerous train,<br/>
			Wind o’er the wave and swell the new domain.<br/>
			For impious Laud, on England’s wasted shore,<br/>
			Renews the flames that Mary fed before;<br/>
			Contristed sects his sullen fury fly,<br/>
			To seek new seats beneath a safer sky;<br/>
			Where faith and freedom yield a forceful charm,<br/>
			And toils and dangers every bosom warm.</p>
			<p>Amid the tried unconquerable train,<br/>
			Whom tyrants press and seas oppose in vain,<br/>
			See Plymouth colons stretch their standards o’er,<br/>
			Face the dark wildmen and the wintry shore;<br/>
			See virtuous Baltimore ascend the wave,<br/>
			See peaceful Penn its unknown terrors brave;<br/>
			Swedes, Belgians, Gauls their various flags display,<br/>
			Full pinions crowding on the watery way;<br/>
			All from their different ports, their sails unfurl’d,<br/>
			Point their glad streamers to the western world.</p>
